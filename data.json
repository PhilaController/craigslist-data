The building allows leases on flexible timeframes, so you would be able to renew for just a month or two if you wanted (or go as far as a 2year lease).\nThe building has a 24\/7 doorman, fully equipped gym, lovely communal spaces, a beautiful roof deck with a view of the city, and a heated pool. It's also a pet friendly building, if you have (or want!) any furry friends. There is also an attached garage (for an extra fee) should you want to park a car in the building.\nThe apartment itself is a large 1br, with a dishwasher, in-unit washer\/dryer, central air, and brand new appliances. It's FIOS equipped so your internet is lightning fast.

The bathroom is tastefully done and includes a shower\/tub combination and high end vanity and medicine cabinet. All drawers and doors have soft close hinges. A continuous draw fan will ensure a dry hygienic environment for you. Heating and Air-conditioning is through high-efficiency Fujitsu mini-split units.
