Preferably, a 2 bedroom in a quiet neighborhood. Yes, there are cheaper\/affordable apartments available in SB, but the areas not so great and rowdy.

I am currently disabled and on SSI. I have no pets, but I don't mind if you do. I do not drink, do drugs, or smoke. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP machine but might still snore, so my roommate should be okay with it. Shared bathroom is OK.

Trying to stick to the Inland Empire (San Bernardino-Redlands-Loma Linda-Highland-Rialto-Yucaipa and adjoining areas) for housing as that's where I get my health services. Prefer housemates, but will consider f I don't share a room with them. The focal point of this home is its expansive living area that was completely reimagined by the current owners. The upgrades include a brand new kitchen island\/dry bar area that has ample storage for all your entertaining needs as well as modifications to the living space to take advantage of its size, creating a true home. The windowed kitchen just off the dining area is perfectly situated between both bedrooms creating ideal separation of space and privacy. The thoughtfully renovated kitchen comes fully equipped with top of the line stainless steel appliances and is beautifully adorned with quartz countertops and tasteful modern tile backsplash. Adjoining the kitchen is the perk of a windowed powder room, which is set perfectly next to some additional storage captured during the renovation. Unwind after a long day in the oversized and airy primary bedroom with its own ensuite bath with full soaking tub. This room has two oversized windows allowing endless sunlight to pour in from its south and east exposures. A wall of custom built in closets maximizes the use of space. The second bedroom can double as a home office with a new custom closet that has been added. The two windows are a welcoming touch to this sunlit room. This unique, huge, corner 1 bedroom suite cant be missed. The living room, fully lined with windows on two sides looks out over the trees of Roslyn Road. Fabulously maintained details date back to the early 1900s, keeping the heritage feel of the building like you are in a time capsule. Best of all, this building is located in the heart of Osborne Village. Steps away from Winnipeg's most vibrant neighborhood, you have access to the best of Winnipeg's eclectic community.The basics like Safeway, Shoppers Drugmart and Shell are just steps away, yet all the adventure of famous restaurants, lounges and boutique shops are just around the corner..\"\n","num_images":4.0,"lat":39.9513,"lng":-75.1741,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1.5Ba', 'apartment', 'w\/d hookups', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-06-22T12:21:24-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-brewerytown-bed-bath-bi\/7499765704.html","post_id":7499765704,"result_date":"2022-06-22 12:23","title":"Brewerytown 3 bed 3 bath bi-level apt with parking, C\/A & more!","description":"2426 W Thompson St #1 \u2013 Premium 3 bed 3 bath bi-level first and sublevel apt with parking space & more!\nDiscover the art of living well in the depths of this brand new 3 bed 3 bath bi-level Brewerytown reno with your very own parking space!

The upgrades include a brand new kitchen island\/dry bar area that has ample storage for all your entertaining needs as well as modifications to the living space to take advantage of its size, creating a true home. The windowed kitchen just off the dining area is perfectly situated between both bedrooms creating ideal separation of space and privacy.

This room has two oversized windows allowing endless sunlight to pour in from its south and east exposures. A wall of custom built in closets maximizes the use of space. The second bedroom can double as a home office with a new custom closet that has been added. The two windows are a welcoming touch to this sunlit room. This unique, huge, corner 1 bedroom suite cant be missed. The living room, fully lined with windows on two sides looks out over the trees of Roslyn Road. Fabulously maintained details date back to the early 1900s, keeping the heritage feel of the building like you are in a time capsule.

Preferably, a 2 bedroom in a quiet neighborhood. Yes, there are cheaper\/affordable apartments available in SB, but the areas not so great and rowdy.

So everyone, beware.\nLooking to move at the end of July. Thank you for your time.\nWe are looking for host families for the following dates:\nI am a 51 year old  I am looking for a private room or a room shared with another . I have until July 16th to find another room to rent and move out, however my current roommate is a paranoid schizophrenic and is driving me crazy. If I move out earlier, my landlord will not care. I am currently disabled and on SSI. I have no pets, but I don't mind if you do. I do not drink, do drugs, or smoke. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP machine but might still snore, so my roommate should be okay with it. Shared bathroom is OK. I have dietary restrictions due to diabetes, so I do require kitchen privileges of some sort. I am quiet and will clean up after myself. Looking to rent a furnished room, $500 including utilities. Trying to stick to the Inland Empire (San Bernardino-Redlands-Loma Linda-Highland-Rialto-Yucaipa and adjoining areas) for housing as that's where I get my health services. Prefer  housemates, but will consider f I don't share a room with them.\nThe focal point of this home is its expansive living area that was completely reimagined by the current owners. The upgrades include a brand new kitchen island\/dry bar area that has ample storage for all your entertaining needs as well as modifications to the living space to take advantage of its size, creating a true home. The windowed kitchen just off the dining area is perfectly situated between both bedrooms creating ideal separation of space and privacy. The thoughtfully renovated kitchen comes fully equipped with top of the line stainless steel appliances and is beautifully adorned with quartz countertops and tasteful modern tile backsplash. Adjoining the kitchen is the perk of a windowed powder room, which is set perfectly next to some additional storage captured during the renovation.\nUnwind after a long day in the oversized and airy primary bedroom with its own ensuite bath with full soaking tub. This room has two oversized windows allowing endless sunlight to pour in from its south and east exposures. A wall of custom built in closets maximizes the use of space. The second bedroom can double as a home office with a new custom closet that has been added. The two windows are a welcoming touch to this sunlit room.\nThis unique, huge, corner 1 bedroom suite cant be missed. The living room, fully lined with windows on two sides looks out over the trees of Roslyn Road. Fabulously maintained details date back to the early 1900s, keeping the heritage feel of the building like you are in a time capsule.\nBest of all, this building is located in the heart of Osborne Village. Steps away from Winnipeg's most vibrant neighborhood, you have access to the best of Winnipeg's eclectic community.The basics like Safeway, Shoppers Drugmart and Shell are just steps away, yet all the adventure of famous restaurants, lounges and boutique shops are just around the corner..\"\n","num_images":4.0,"lat":40.0247,"lng":-75.0518,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1.5Ba', 'apartment', 'w\/d hookups', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-06-22T10:45:55-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-spacious-one-bedroom-with\/7499706655.html","post_id":7499706655,"result_date":"2022-06-22 10:45","title":"Spacious One bedroom with private yard and heat included","description":"Spacious One bedroom with private backyard with heat included in the wonderful neighborhood of Fairmount.

Two roommates are looking for someone to fill a bedroom in our East Kensington apartment. We\u2019ve lived here just about a year, and it\u2019s been great. There\u2019s plenty of space, a giant roof deck, and it\u2019s only a block away from the York\/Dauphin stop on the El, so getting around the city is super easy. Parking is never a problem either. The open bedroom is on the first floor and has a cute balcony. Your bathroom is right outside the bedroom. Rent is $1000 a month + utilities so altogether it\u2019s ~$1000. Move in would be July 1, but we can try and work with you if you\u2019re looking to make an earlier move.\nAbout us: We are two young professionals in our twenties! Mollie is a teacher and MaryBeth works at a local radio station. Mollie loves to bake so we always have plenty of cookies to try ;) We also have a cat named Uno, so no new pets!\n","num_images":0.0,"lat":39.9513,"lng":-75.1741,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '800ft2', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-06-22T07:51:27-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/woodlyn-need-2-bedroom-come-to-green\/7499652749.html","post_id":7499652749,"result_date":"2022-06-22 07:58","title":"Need a 2 Bedroom?

Preferably, a 2 bedroom in a quiet neighborhood. Yes, there are cheaper\/affordable apartments available in SB, but the areas not so great and rowdy. Only reason I\u2019m still looking for a place in the city of SB is because my daughter goes to a really good magnet school.

I don\u2019t communicate through text or emails, so if you respond via email with no name and phone contact for me to call, don\u2019t bother.

We are looking for host families for the following dates: I am a 51 year old I am looking for a private room or a room shared with another . I have until July 16th to find another room to rent and move out, however my current roommate is a paranoid schizophrenic and is driving me crazy. If I move out earlier, my landlord will not care. I am currently disabled and on SSI. I have no pets, but I don't mind if you do. I do not drink, do drugs, or smoke. I have sleep apnea and a CPAP machine but might still snore, so my roommate should be okay with it. Shared bathroom is OK. I have dietary restrictions due to diabetes, so I do require kitchen privileges of some sort. I am quiet and will clean up after myself. Looking to rent a furnished room, $500 including utilities. Trying to stick to the Inland Empire (San Bernardino-Redlands-Loma Linda-Highland-Rialto-Yucaipa and adjoining areas) for housing as that's where I get my health services. Prefer housemates, but will consider f I don't share a room with them. The focal point of this home is its expansive living area that was completely reimagined by the current owners. The upgrades include a brand new kitchen island\/dry bar area that has ample storage for all your entertaining needs as well as modifications to the living space to take advantage of its size, creating a true home. The windowed kitchen just off the dining area is perfectly situated between both bedrooms creating ideal separation of space and privacy. The thoughtfully renovated kitchen comes fully equipped with top of the line stainless steel appliances and is beautifully adorned with quartz countertops and tasteful modern tile backsplash. Adjoining the kitchen is the perk of a windowed powder room, which is set perfectly next to some additional storage captured during the renovation. Unwind after a long day in the oversized and airy primary bedroom with its own ensuite bath with full soaking tub. This room has two oversized windows allowing endless sunlight to pour in from its south and east exposures. A wall of custom built in closets maximizes the use of space. The second bedroom can double as a home office with a new custom closet that has been added. The two windows are a welcoming touch to this sunlit room. This unique, huge, corner 1 bedroom suite cant be missed. The living room, fully lined with windows on two sides looks out over the trees of Roslyn Road. Fabulously maintained details date back to the early 1900s, keeping the heritage feel of the building like you are in a time capsule. Best of all, this building is located in the heart of Osborne Village. Steps away from Winnipeg's most vibrant neighborhood, you have access to the best of Winnipeg's eclectic community.The basics like Safeway, Shoppers Drugmart and Shell are just steps away, yet all the adventure of famous restaurants, lounges and boutique shops are just around the corner..\"","num_images":6.0,"lat":40.013,"lng":-75.132,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-06-22T13:29:44-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-studio-apts-becoming\/7499804111.html","post_id":7499804111,"result_date":"2022-06-22 13:32","title":"Studio Apts.
