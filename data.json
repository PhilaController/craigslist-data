Steps from the Schuykill River and Trail","description":"2429 Locust St, Philadelphia, PA 19103\nWhat a lovely setting! Steps from the Schuykill River and Trail, on a quiet, shaded section of Fitler Square stands Locust Point, a 110-unit structure converted from a bible factory to condominiums by Carl Dranoff in 2007. There is so much to like here. You\u2019re removed from the hustle and bustle of Rittenhouse Square, yet you can easily walk or bike to the attractions there or in Center City. Equally close are Penn and Drexel, accessible via the Walnut St Bridge less than a block away. ENTRANCE: One enters the building through two doors accessible using a fob into an attractive, contemporary 2-story lobby with seating areas and floor to ceiling windows. Off the lobby is a covered, outside seating area. At the back of the lobby is the gym. There is onsite management by Reinhold Residential during the week in an office just inside the entrance. UNIT ENTRANCE: Enter into a small vestibule with coat closet and the bathroom which also contains the washer\/dryer. Steps on the left lead to the lofted bedroom. As one proceeds down the hallway, one notices the beautiful dark hardwood floor and is struck by the spacious feeling created by the high ceilings and light coming in from the oversize windows. It\u2019s also very quiet due to the soundproofed walls of the building. LIVING AREA: The open floor plan allows light to stream through the space and is well suited to entertaining. The kitchen features stainless steel appliances, handsome cherry cabinets offering plenty of storage space, granite counter tops and an island with seating for four. There\u2019s plenty of room for a couch, TV and desk in the sitting area and a beautiful view of the trees lining Locust St out the window. NEARBY: The Schuykill River Park is a block away and offers a dog park, tennis courts, basketball courts and a playground. AMENITIES: There is a gym, a package room and a fenced dog run.\n","num_images":14.0,"lat":39.9513,"lng":-75.1741,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-06-08T01:21:18-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-newly-renovated-bedroom\/7630116516.html","post_id":7630116516,"title":"Newly renovated 1 Bedroom apartment is ready for you to call home.","description":"Newly renovated 1 Bedroom apartment is ready for you to call home.\nconveniently located within walking distance from Big Y, Subway, KFC, DD and much more.\nbonus space\nenclosed porch with plenty of natural light and windows.\nbrand new appliances.\npets are welcome on case by case, vouchers are welcome.\nMUST BE ABLE TO PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK.\nNO CREDIT IS GOOD CREDIT.\nCALL OR EMAIL FOR A VIDEO TOUR BEFORE YOU COME.\n-1 YEAR LEASE WITH OPTION TO RENEW OR MONTH TO MONTH\n-ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING IN THE APARTMENT\n- PETS ALLOWED ON CASE BY CASE\n-MUST BE CLEAN AND KEEP THE PLACE TIDY\n-NO LOUD MUSIC\n-MUST BE ABLE TO PASS BACKGROUND CHECK.\n-VOUCHERS ARE WELCOME\n","num_images":0.0,"lat":40.0402,"lng":-75.2231,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'air conditioning', 'apartment', 'w\/d hookups', 'no smoking', 'detached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-06-07T23:52:11-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-all-new-bedrooms-bath\/7630111677.html","post_id":7630111677,"title":"\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 ALL NEW, 2 BEDROOMS & 2 BATH APARTMENT LOCATED IN WEST PHILADELPHI","description":"Property Address\n4130 W Girard Ave | PHILADELPHIA PA 19104\nAvailable for immediate move-in\nOffered By:\nRedblock Realty Inc. |  show contact info\nDescription\n\u2714\ufe0f NOT YOUR USUAL APARTMENT, CAN YOU SAY OVERSIZED?\n\u2714\ufe0f ALL BRAND NEW!

In the photos you may notice a few incomplete details, which will be taken care of over the next two weeks!\nVery important note about this apartment--\nBecause of the third floor, there are slanted ceilings in some rooms. The bathroom has been particularly affected by this. The slant is right above the tub\/shower. I'm 5'6\" and when I stand in there, there is just a couple inches above my head. To get under the showerhead I would need to bend a bit.\n*** So this apartment is best suited for someone on the shorter side! ***\nTHE APARTMENT AND COMPANY:\nLocated on the 100 block of East Washington Lane\nWill be ready for a July 1st move-in. (Maybe a little sooner)\nBrand new floors, fresh paint\nKitchen has two windows and plenty of room for a dining table\nApartment is on the 3rd floor in a 3-unit house. There is no elevator.\nOne bedroom is quite large. The second bedroom and the living room are on the smaller side, used to be one combined room and the prior owner built a wall down the center.\nThe price includes water only. Tenants are responsible for their own electric and gas. The heat is gas.\nLaundry is located at the 1st floor rear of the house, shared with the tenants of the other two apartments.\nThere is a yard for all tenants to share.\nPets are ok, small refundable deposit required.\nNo smoking.\nWe are a small company, management and owners all live close by in Germantown. Maintenance and repairs are done with independent  contractors.\nFirst, last, and security required to sign lease\/receive keys.\nWHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:\nWe always prefer to rent to folks who are already part of the community, so if you're in Germantown, we'd love to keep you here.\nWe look for income to be close to 3 times the amount of rent, because we want to  know that you can afford it. (This isn't a hard rule, but an estimate) So here that would mean income of around $3300\/month. We request income documentation to demonstrate this.\nWe want tenants who will be considerate of their neighbors in terms of sound and how they use their space. There's not a ton of insulation between each level.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nIf this sounds like you, please send a message. You will be asked a few questions prior to the scheduling of a showing.  Know that we do not waste time showing our apartments to as many people  as possible. So if you meet the criteria, are interested in renting, and you fill out the  application, you are not wasting your time.\nThere is no application fee.\nYou're less likely to get a response if you just ask me if the apartment is available. It's best to give more of an introduction about yourself, your timeline, etc.","num_images":4.0,"lat":40.044488,"lng":-75.179606,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1Ba', 'available jul 1', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-06-08T13:14:40-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-lovely-bedroom-bathroom\/7630265183.html","post_id":7630265183,"title":"@@Lovely 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment for rent.***","description":"Charming large one bedroom lower flat.

Just off the kitchen is the extra wide, open concept living and dining area. The living room also features a unique shiplap bump-out adorned against exposed brick, perfect for mounting a TV or artwork. The stackable GE laundry center is located just off the living room. At the front of the property is the primary bedroom with a gorgeous feature wall with custom sconces, en-suite bathroom with tub, and barn door leading to the custom designed closet. Tucked away in the front corner of the primary is a custom built-in nook, complete with extra drawers and storage space. At the rear of the property is another large bedroom with a spacious closet and 3 windows, allowing the natural light to pour right in. The Penthouse has exceptionally tall ceiling heights north of 11 feet. Head upstairs to the completely private full building sized roof deck (almost 1,000 sq ft!), showcasing unobstructed views of Philadelphia that will take your breath away. The roof deck is accessed through a private pilot house with additional windows allowing more natural light to flow through the unit. Central air, white oak hardwood floors, and so much more make this unit absolutely remarkable! The front entry doors have been restored to pay homage to the history of the property, and the common entryway has been tiled to perfection. Each unit comes with its own separate Ring Doorbell for convenience and ease. Super low estimated HOA fees of approximately $132 per month. Last but not least, this condo comes with a fully approved 10-year rehab tax abatement. Rarely does a home with this design aesthetic come to the market at such a competitive price.
