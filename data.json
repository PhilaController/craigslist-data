Highlights and rent below.\nHighlights: Private backyard, Central Heat and A\/C, hardwood floors, dishwasher, very nice and spacious kitchen with a large granite counter-top island. Washer\/Dryer is coin-operated and in the basement but that\u2019s okay since the unit is on the 1st floor. Extremely convenient is the 34 and 13 trollies across the street which go straight to campus. The neighborhood is served by the Penn and University City District security guards and is also on the Penn bus\/shuttle route. It\u2019s a nice area with many restaurants, coffee shop, and a farmer\u2019s market in Clark park across the street every weekend.\nMy opinion: I am the current renter and am moving to work in Delaware. For full-disclosure, I am posting to get subletters during the last two months of my rent (June and July) since I am moving late May. So though I\u2019m incentivized to advertise the apt, my liking of the apt is genuine as I of course chose to live here myself. When I was searching for apts, this was a no-brainer because it was the only apt that was 2BR, walking distance to campus, <$1,700\/mo, in a nice neighborhood, and actually nice inside (hardwood floors, central heating and A\/C, very large spacious kitchen and nice private backyard). We\u2019ve also never seen a mouse in the apartment; landlords for other places will defend mice issues by saying you\u2019ll find that everywhere, but that is not true.\nJune and July rent: $1650\nRent starting August 1st: $1675\nThis is available as a sublease from the end of May to the end of July with the option of extending the lease from 8\/1\/23-7\/31\/24. If it is a sublease only, the sublease must end on 7\/31\/23 by 12:00 noon. There is also a $25\/month fee for puts \u2013 cats are allowed, dogs are not.\nIf you are interested, please message me a few dates\/times in which you are available for a showing, and answer the pre-screening questions below as per the landlord\u2019s request:\n1.\tWhat do you do for a living?\n2.\tWhat is your income and credit score?\n3.\tWho will occupy the unit?\n4.\tAny pets?","num_images":10.0,"lat":39.9597,"lng":-75.2024,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1Ba', '900ft2', 'available may 29', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-04-26T13:18:54-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/west-chester-bd-ba-garages-situated-in\/7614645784.html","post_id":7614645784,"title":"3\/BD 2\/BA, Garages, Situated in West Chester!","description":"YES, WE ARE OPEN!
