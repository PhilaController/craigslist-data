One of the few one- bedroom units in this community with a loft that can be used as a second bedroom! Upon entry into this move-in ready unit, you\u2019ll be greeted by tasteful engineered hardwood flooring running throughout the main floor. The kitchen has granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, including a built-in microwave, and plenty of cabinet space. A stackable washer and dryer are in a closet off the kitchen for convenience. Between the kitchen and living room, the dining area offers plenty of room for a table and chairs to enjoy meals. The living area is a wonderful location to unwind after a long day. Three windows overlooking the courtyard offer plenty of natural sunlight, and the cathedral ceiling with recessed lighting adds to the open feeling on the main level. A hallway off the kitchen leads to a warm and inviting bedroom with the same flooring, plenty of natural light, and closet space. The bathroom across the hall from the bedroom is ample in size, with tile flooring and a step-in tub shower with glass doors. A staircase connects the main floor to the loft - a carpeted area which makes working from home a breeze. The loft has plenty of room for a pull-out couch or bed for guests, with a half-wall allowing for privacy while still having the ability to overlook the main living area. Newer (2020) HVAC. This unit comes with a dedicated parking spot that is in close proximity to the back door and elevator.
