Million dollar View Hilltop location selected by a surveyor (General Washington) as one of the best defensive military positions ever. Yep we think they could have camped or had sentries in the backyard! Beautiful 11 Acre Wood lot filled with game and 4 acres of Washington Crossing caviar (raspberries) and about 3 ac. Of open land and some of the land zoned commercial. Splendid four bedroom 2.5 bath house. Is now an operating Airbnb that generates as much as 9200 per month gross if fully occupied. It was neglected for many years and the current owner has slowly brought the interior to a repaired enough code compliant level that the operations go on here with great reviews. However the building needs lots of additional work to Simply Be what was built here in good repair. Here's the deal: this house if it were in good repair would rent for $4,800 per month under a typical first month last month one month security structure. However, I value the repairs as much as payment. We do not want to remodel as much as get what is already here back to well repaired condition. A substantial amount of Down money for this rental maybe paid in cash or repair (across the entire Spectrum of construction work) done before entry. Some cash flow is needed by the owner, but a substantial portion of the rent going forward and sometimes all of the rent may be justified can be paid for with work at the property. The property was bought for resale. However, a final decision for disposition and a time and for that has not been set and circumstances could arise where the property is never offered for sale. However, if it does get offered as originally planned the person doing this deal would be in a position to possibly purchase and to use Sweat Equity as a means to satisfy a lender. If this property were added to modestly, for example the personal Billiards nightclub in the basement finished and the walk out ability that it has perfected this property would be worth way more than it is now let alone going up higher on its existing built like a bomb shelter Stone fronted Foundation. It is not presently worth 4800 a month which is what it would rent for very quickly in ship shape. So the rent payments would have to step up based on a time schedule. Starting with what it's worth now as a single home needing you, cheap at $3,000 and then rising to the market as it rises to the market value in repairs. This would be based on a relaxed schedule. The person interested must be able to do business on the highest levels of integrity and have an open and honest presentation of all personal information and references Allowed by law so that the owner can embark on this program safely, simply and easily.","num_images":0.0,"lat":40.290347,"lng":-74.881544,"attrs":"['4BR \/ 2.5Ba', '2600ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-01-16T14:37:22-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-looking-for-change\/7579182844.html","post_id":7579182844,"result_date":"Mon Jan 16 2023 19:38:53 GMT+0000 ","title":"Looking for a change?
