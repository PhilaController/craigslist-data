The first level of the home is the garage that spans the length of the home followed by the rear yard that can be used for gardening, relaxing and entertaining. Up the stairs you have the main level of the home that is completely open with massively tall ceilings and incredible natural light. The tiered level has the living and dining space on the lower level and full kitchen with eat in nook on the upper level. The kitchen has been recently remodeled with new countertops and fixtures. The top level features three bedrooms, stackable laundry closet, hall bathroom and a brand new primary bathroom. The primary bathroom is jawdropping with accented barn door, wall to wall mirrors, gorgeous tiling, waterfall shower and free standing tub.
