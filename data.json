We now live in a 5 bedroom house. Have lived here for 9 years and have enjoyed it but the cost of living is going up. I would like to move into a house that has an extra room for rent. Or a house to rent myself. I own a remodeling co. So its fine if it is a fixerup. I would be willing to trade my skills for rent or deposit. Feel free to ask for any situation and maybe we can make a deal. ThanxI have been trying to find a room and they\u2019re usually scams or the people want me to meet them and I can\u2019t because I\u2019m a days drive away. Please don\u2019t be like a lot of people and tell me that I MUST chill with you and like everything you like. I have my own life and stay busy most times and can entertain myself in an empty room. I act and I write but I will be working bartending there and getting another part time job. I may sound grumpy here but I\u2019m just trying to convey what I need and show I\u2019m serious about it. I just need a safe secure place month you month for about two months until I save enough to get out. 600-750$ price range. I have had my money stolen by my room mate here and my car stolen. I will be traveling lightly and I\u2019m 420 friendly, drink occasionally and I\u2019m pretty laid back. I\u2019m hoping putting this out will rid most of the scams and maybe women will see I\u2019m real and respond lol I will be moving September 1st so I would love a place by then. I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, organized and pick up after myself. Respectful of others time and space. I check my email through the day. Thanks! My business partner and i are seeking a home in Portland where we can rent out a 2-3 BD house or condo to expand our business. We host traveling nurses, flight attendants, and young professionals for all in which we do soft background checks, Government ID check verification, and must be 21+. Our previous home owners have found this preferably more beneficial to their property because we keep it well maintained and have professional cleaners come in for weekly cleanings. In addition, we offer our homeowners and\/or agents a couple hundred in addition to their asking rent or larger deposits. let us know if this is an opportunity that interests you and would like to join our booming short term rental community in the metro portland area!

That being said I\u2019m dealing with medical collections due to a bout with cancer. I beat it but it kicked my butt. Obviously my credit isn\u2019t good as a result. NO evictions, currently residing in Springfield. Would prefer to stay close to work. I do drive a transit van for work, it would be nice to have parking for it ( it\u2019s tall, off street?)\nOn a personal note, I\u2019m pretty boring these days, not into partying and such. Hobby wise I\u2019m into my motorcycle, RC models, sci fi ( really kinda a big nerd) . I enjoy a good steak , anything Asian cuisine , and make a mean pork loin on the BBQ. Like I mentioned before, mostly keep to myself these days, I have an adult daughter that may visit occasionally, not one for a lot of visitors. I\u2019m a Monday thru Friday guy, Up early , working full time.\nIdeal situation would be a shop\/ mother in law suite, I\u2019m also good with traditional room for rent situations, just not looking for the usual \u201c we\u2019re thirty something\u2019s or prefer a traveling nurse\u201d like I see everywhere. I\u2019m handy and don\u2019t mind helping around the house but not interested in work trades. Have cash ready for deposits and such. Happy to discuss advance rent or larger deposits in lieu of credit score ( working on it but takes time) , feel free to reach out, nothin to hide\nIf your looking for a stable , quiet, and mature tenant, let\u2019s talk\nJDI am in need for stable housing, preferably a month to month situation or year long lease.

I just need a bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, dinette. I can get my own wifi or use a hotspot for my online classes. I can pay for utilities as well.\nI have a small\/medium dog, who is the most calm, chill, well behaved dog I've ever met. He gets along with other dogs really well and is fixed. Hello.
