Looking for a downtown Philadelphia apartment near Rittenhouse Square? You've found it! ICON is the most exciting rental property to ever grace Rittenhouse Square.

The lobby is so stunning it will make you stop in your tracks, with its Art Deco-styled elevators, glazed black brick and grey porcelain flooring and a cast-bronze portal.
