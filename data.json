When you step inside the combined living, kitchen and dining space you immediately notice how thoughtful design has seamlessly melded them together.\nThe kitchen is an L-shape design and smartly blended into the space with a cool geometric black and white backsplash that extends to the ceiling, floating shelves for extra storage and grounded by modern black cabinets. A retro-inspired black Galanz refrigerator provides a fun accent in this space. There is a smartly added pantry tucked away behind the kitchen with shelving for small appliance storage and even a dedicated space for your coats and shoes.\nBetween the kitchen and living areas there is ample space to place a dining table should you wish to have one. The living area is a perfect spot to lounge and enjoy stunning skyline views and evening sunsets beautifully displayed thanks to the two-story window. Up a custom iron stairway, you\u2019ll find the bedroom space. This lofted bedroom has high ceilings showcasing the unit\u2019s exposed steel beams and gets good natural light from the window below. It features recently refinished hardwood floors and extra space to place a wardrobe for clothing storage.\nNext to the bedroom is a large spa-like bathroom with a walk-in glass stall shower featuring subtle iridescent mini mosaic wall tile, a soaking tub (perfect for some self-care time!) and two black floating vanities with storage. A stackable Maytag washer and dryer is in a closet next to the bathroom for convenience.\nThis unit is located in an ideal location for a Philly foodie, just two blocks to all the Italian Market has to offer including outdoor fun at Piazza di Bruno, dining at Fiorella\u2019s, Villa di Roma, Roxanne and the many other restaurants and cafes located in the market. For shopping, it\u2019s a short walk to Sprouts and Target at Lincoln Square and to all the stores and dining along the Passyunk Avenue corridor.\nThe unit is also close to public transportation at the Broad Street subway line, on the 4 & 45 bus routes and an easy drive along Washington Avenue to access I-95 and I-76. The building itself features a 24-hour doorperson, fully equipped fitness center, large community room with kitchen and even bike storage. There is plenty of permitted street parking on the streets surrounding the building and a loading zone in front of the main entrance to make it easy to unload groceries and other items.\nNo Pets Allowed\nListing provided by Compass Pennsylvania LLC\n","num_images":15.0,"lat":39.937157,"lng":-75.161399,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '1002ft2', 'available jun 1', 'air conditioning', 'application fee details: $50', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-03-29T17:19:28-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-brand-new-fishtown-1bd\/7604751895.html","post_id":7604751895,"title":"Brand New Fishtown 1bd. 1 MONTH FREE RENT!!

In typical loft fashion, the living and kitchen spaces are combined, unified by gleaming mid-tone hardwood floors. This combined living space is sizeable enough to accommodate large scale furniture including a dining set with room to spare.\nThe modified galley-style kitchen features dark-colored cabinetry accented by sleek black granite countertops, cool glass tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances. The layout of the kitchen provides lots of cabinet space. The large kitchen island is ideal for casual at home dining and provides a focal gathering point when entertaining friends and family.\nUp a small set of steps, off the main living area, the bedroom space is an open style with a walk-in closet big enough to make all your wardrobe storage dreams come true. The bathroom is located off the main hallway and features a neutral color scheme with gray tile, crisp white vanity with room for storage and a jetted tub (perfect way to get some self-care time in!). A closet located off the bathroom cleverly conceals a newer front-loading washer and dryer while providing extra storage space.\nThis particular unit even has a large storage area accessible under the bedroom space, a rare find in the city! The building also offers a fully equipped gym. Not only is this property a short walk to 30th Street Station, Suburban Station, UPENNs campus and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, it is also close to many local favorites including Rosy\u2019s Taco Bar, El Merkury and Butcher Bar, easy grocery shopping at the new Giant Market and Traders Joes. Additional greenspace for walking, biking and lounging is close by at the Schyulkill River Banks as well as at the Sunset Social rooftop just a short walk away over the Walnut Street Bridge.\nListing provided by Compass Pennsylvania LLC\n","num_images":14.0,"lat":39.955854,"lng":-75.176654,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '932ft2', 'available jun 1', 'air conditioning', 'application fee details: $50', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-03-29T09:27:00-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-limited-time-special-at\/7604531272.html","post_id":7604531272,"title":"LIMITED TIME SPECIAL AT EMERSON APARTMENTS!","description":"EMERSON APARTMENTS\nWe are located in the greater northeast section of Philadelphia right off of Bustleton\nAvenue with Evarts as the cross street.
