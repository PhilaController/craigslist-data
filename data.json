Your premier apartment residences are located in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia. Conveniently located by St. Joes University, this building is home to 111 apartments, a mixture of studios to 1-2 beds, 4 commercial spaces, and 43 parking spaces. Be welcomed by three planted courtyards that provide The Elm residents with green spaces to connect them to the outdoors and nature. The main central courtyard plaza is welcoming, active, and used as a communal gathering area; it also serves as the main entrance to the apartment units. The building incorporates a green roof, porous pavers, and interior vegetated areas including beautiful trees that have been newly planted in the interior courtyards beside its existing foliage. Never worry about finding parking with access to a driveway that leads to a private and concealed lot behind and under the rear of the building. Look forward to 6129 sf of commercial space oriented towards 63rd street. Each commercial space has direct access to the street and they have access from the central courtyard plaza. Grab coffee right outside your door before heading to class or on your way to study. On the site, there is also a historically contributing building, which The Elm has been designed around.
