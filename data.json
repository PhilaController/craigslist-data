She just came back to Bend to be closer to her family who is 5th generation Oregonian. She has lived in rentals and has had roommates her whole life. Which does however mean that her references are in french, and she has not yet had time to build a credit score (guess it's not a universal thing). She'll happily translate references for you, has cosigners available, and is willing to negotiate a higher deposit to provide the reassurance you may need.\nIf your rental is available we'd love to hear back from you and give it a look.I'm a 30 year old mother of 2 young ones, 5 and 4.
