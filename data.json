The common space will be semi-furnished when you move in, and we can collectively determine how to furnish it.\nThe building has a rooftop with great views of the city, and a second floor patio for barbecues and hang outs -- see pictures! This is also a gated building complex, with security at night. There is a package room for your packages and mail boxes.\nParking space possibly available in the attached garage, and there is ample street parking.\nAvailable Bedroom (unfurnished when you move in):\nVery sizable space, photos are shown with furniture to give you an idea of the space.

This neighbourhood is also slowly getting gentrified and new opportunities will arise while you are here.\nI personally bike to work (see my bike in the picture) and it takes me 12 mins to get to my office which is close to CHOP. It is a very pleasant ride, either with designated bike lanes, or single lane fares.\nFirst, last, and security deposits are needed to hold the apt and you will need to provide proof of employment and sign a sublease before move in.\nShowing now so email to schedule a time to see the place!
