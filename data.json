We are responsible renters with nearly 12 years of perfect rental history in Springfield. Our income is 6k plus a month and I do Maintenance as my profession. I can do home or apartment Maintenance. We have great referencesMy name is Shannon and I\u2019ve just moved to Seattle from the New Orleans area for a job teaching with a local theatre company, first their summer camps then full-time with them. A little more about me: I\u2019ve been a professional actor \/ special events specialist for almost 25 years in both fields. I have my own production company and I\u2019m looking to actually produce some wonderful theatre here with a few friends who have been based here that I went to graduate school in London with about 5 years ago.\nPersonally, I\u2019m very clean and chill and really adore the same. Being from New Orleans, I do love to cook!\nI don\u2019t have really any furniture so if there\u2019s any chance it could come semi-furnished that would be wonderful but not a necessity. I\u2019m looking to move as soon as possible. I'm looking for a roommate, studio or sublet situation and I'm open to most areas of Seattle. I'm hoping to keep the cost under $900-950 total if possible. Ideally, I'd love to find someone who's around Capitol Hill-is neighborhood as I work either in Meridian or Jefferson Park, depending on the week. Looking forward to hearing from you! Thanks!Thank you for reading my ad. I am a 40 year old straight Progressive LGBTQ friendly  looking for a room to rent in or around the St. Johns neighborhood of Portland. I'm covid vaccinated, clean, and quiet. I drive a forklift from 4:00pm until 2:30am(usually) anywhere from 4-7 nights a week in a nearby warehouse. Currently, I would prefer to live in a furnished room in and air-conditioned house or apartment with no cats or dogs as I have allergies. I dont drink, smoke, or use drugs but am 420 friendly if you smoke. I enjoy the outdoors, going to the gym, playing video games, watching movies, reading, and discussing any number of topics. My budget is somewhat flexible and looking to move as soon at the end of July or perhaps sooner if the right opportunity presents itself. I don't like drama and would prefer to stay with single individuals unless they're willing to keep their business separate from where I'm living and when I'm in earshot. I need to cook but will always clean up after myself. I prefer to have my own bathroom but if it must be shared than I would be fine sharing a weekly cleaning schedule. I need a clear parking spot as well. When I'm not working I tend to keep to myself as I need sleep and time to focus on my Ebay business. I can be sociable when the mood is right but like my space. If you have any questions feel free to contact me by phone. Don't waste my time or yours by trying to scam me or ask me for my email so you can send me \"\"\"\"pictures\"\"\"\". I'll send a photo of myself if you wish to see one.Hello! My name is Justin, I\u2019m 28 years old. I\u2019ve just moved back here from Arizona recently. I currently live in Hazel Dell but I\u2019m looking to be closer to my job. I work in customer service from 7:30 to 4:00pm in Beaverton. As long as I\u2019m within 10 miles then I\u2019ll be happy to move. In my free time I enjoy being active whether it\u2019s playing sports, going on a hike or just being outdoors. I don\u2019t party much, just mainly hanging out with friends. Other than that I\u2019m a laid back guy and pretty much get along with anyone. Ideally I would like to FaceTime\/Skype before meeting just to weed out the scammers. Also, the soonest I could move in is July 15th.

I\u2019m a 53-year-old professional who is clean, quiet and respectful with no pets and  . My ideal situation would be a mother-in-law unit or something similar with an outside area like a patio or balcony, but I'm open. I know the market is really tight in this area.\nI\u2019d like to keep costs low, so I\u2019d really like to stay around $800 - $1000 if possible. I don\u2019t need a lot of space, but a full kitchen and standard-sized fridge are a necessity.\nIf this quick intro sounds like it may be a good fit, please let me know and we can set up a time to talk and see if we want to explore this further.\nThanks for your time.Hello I am a single clean Grad student looking to move near by La Miranda.\nI am willing to pay month to month as well as utilities.\nI am willing to pay 650 for rent per month not counting utilities which may make the price higher.\nPlease feel free to reach out to me via text message.\nI am looking to move ASAP, thank you.North-Bound: If you\u2019re on the I-5 N, take CA-91 W, take exit 17B to merge onto I-605 N.
