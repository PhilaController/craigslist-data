They've both been there for over 5 years - so ideally we'd like someone looking for a long term living situation.\nThe room itself is on the second floor and is a good size, fits a queen bed with plenty of space for a desk and tons of storage. It has 3 windows, with one facing West towards the sun. The room has a nice little closet to stash your clothes (has a bar for hangers and a top shelf area).\nThere's a double lot backyard, so it runs very deep and is great for parties\/backyard BBQs! We have a gas and charcoal grill, a cement patio, tables\/chairs, and a cool little fire pit.\nThere's one shared bathroom, but this has never been an issue sharing (especially since one of the housemates is rarely ever there). We've had both guys and girls rent here before, no preference on gender (or lack thereof.)\nMail Delivery: Side alley allows for packages to be easily and safely dropped off when no one is home (UPS and USPS have been doing this for years already).\nUtilities: ~$70-80 (varies by month and usage, highest is around $120 in the winter if running the heat high). We have Verizon internet, but are also wired for Comcast - we switch between both every couple years to get the best rate. The house has gas heat (PGW) and no central air (we all use window units.)\nBasement: Good for storage and nothing else.\nIt's a ~12 minute walk to the Girard El stop and on a very safe, friendly block. There's currently one cat in the house, she's super cool and has lived with other housemate's dogs\/cats in the past. Super close to 95\n-----------------------------------------------------\nNEXT STEP: Send us a little info about you and we can chat to schedule a tour if it seems like a good fit. Expect to meet the other housemates and chat with them, we want to make sure everyone is happy so it works long term.\n","num_images":5.0,"lat":39.972145,"lng":-75.124818,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 1Ba', '165ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'house', 'no laundry on site', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-05-18T13:25:23-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-wonderful-bed-home-in-east\/7485330164.html","post_id":7485330164,"result_date":"2022-05-18 14:57","title":"Wonderful 1 Bed Home in East Germantown","description":"Wonderful 1 Bed Home in East GermantownKHP Property Management | Philadelphia  |   show contact info\n619 E Chelten Ave, Philadelphia,\u00a0PA\u00a019144-1204$950.00 \/ Month- Description:To schedule a showing, submit an application or for our leasing criteria, please visit www.KHPPM.com\/leasing.This wonderful 1 bed home is located in the East Germantown part of Philadelphia. 619 E Chelten Ave #2, Philadelphia, PA 19144 has 655 sq.ft. which offers beautiful natural light and inviting living space.
