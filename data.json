This solid three bedroom, 1 1\/2 bath house, with its gleaming hardwood floors, and newer windows, feels light and airy.  As you come up the steps to the front door, to the left is a patio with room for your grill and outdoor furniture.  From the front door you enter a spacious living room, with a large window overlooking the front yard. This light-filled space has beautifully finished oak floors, and a coat closet for necessities. The essential powder room is on the left, as you walk from the living room into the dining room. The dining room has a double-window, and a stylish pendant light .  The first floor is open, well designed, and coherent. The staircase opposite the front door leads to the second floor with three bedrooms, one bath, a linen closet, and a spacious landing. The primary bedroom sits at the front of the house, and has plenty of closet space and wall space for bed and furnishings. The two additional bedrooms are at the back of the house.
