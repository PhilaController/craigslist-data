This tasteful conversion of this gorgeous building into a well planned out and incredibly well-designed multi-family is a one of a kind! From the outside you'll take in the beauty and charm of this 1915-built beauty. The masonry work is breathtaking! The large front porch, the columns, the brick-work, everything is precise and eye-popping! Walk in the common foyer entrance - you have options to go straight into unit 1, or up the steps to units 2&3. Into unit 1 we go - right into the family room. You'll notice the bright, cheerful, NEW updated and modern look immediately! Gorgeous bamboo floors, a neutral color palette, recessed lighting, and a beautiful glass balcony which looks down into the second lower level of this home. The owners wisely chose to open up the basement to allow natural light and a truly modern approach to this building! Completing this floor are a full bathroom, all tile with gorgeous and smartly-planned accents, and two huge bedrooms! At the back is an exit to the backyard. Head downstairs to the lower level and you'll find a fantastic modern kitchen with all the features you'll want - granite counters with room for seating, wood cabinets with lit glass-door accents, tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances, and a GIANT walk-in pantry! Head back toward the rear of the unit and you'll find a laundry room, powder room, office, and finally a HUGE third bedroom which can also double as a second family room, den, whatever you envision! Head up the stairs to Unit 2, a very similar look and feel with extremely bright and cheery natural light throughout, bamboo floors, an updated modern kitchen, complete with a full complement of appliances! Huge family room area two huge bedrooms and a beautifully designed bathroom! The middle bedroom also allows access to the fire escape. Up the stairs to Unit 3 - similar layout and finishes. Each unit includes on-demand gas-fired tankless hot water, a gas--fired furnace and central AC, and the quality fixtures and finishes you'd expect. Proof is in the figures - the pro-forma rent in our opinion is conservative, this is a great buy! Six years left on the tax abatement! This incredible find can be yours - act NOW.\nIf you are interested in learning more, please leave your phone number. I'll contact you very shortly.
