So much so that when you wash your dishes and leave them out, the dish fairy can do her work without disturbing your rest, relaxation, or relatives. Yes, we're talking about that classic library you've built in your space. That indoor\/outdoor living room leading you out to a patio where you can grill, entertain, and dine alfresco. Or that dining room that can accommodate three generations of your family, your neighbors, and then some on Thanksgiving. Where are you going to find all this and more, right here at 1605 Kater St. The greatest location in the greatest city on earth. Within one physical block, you'll find The Bakers Jar, Tio Flores, Wine Dive, Bob and Barbara's, Freehouse Fitness, Art Sanctuary Gallery, and the 40 bus that takes you to east Penn's Landing or west to the University of Penn and all the way to the Main Line. Just an 11-minute .5 mile walk to Rittenhouse Square, or a 25 minute 1 mile walk to Passyunk Sq. In addition to the handsome brick fa ade with the most charming curb appeal, and your expansive living room with hardwood floors that lead you to the brick patio, downstairs you'll find that aforementioned dish fairy cleaning your well-appointed kitchen. This kitchen is so well laid out it practically cooks and cleans for you. Adjacent you'll find storage and utility room to store all the things that pinterst inspired you to buy but not to use, like a lifetime supply of cupcake sprinkles, a yoga chair, a sewing machine, and a peloton bike. Shut the door and tuck away all those to-do's. Venture upstairs, toss a bath bomb, and soak your cares away in the freestanding tub in your luxury bathroom with separate stand up shower, and double sinks. This is the perfect bathroom for two people, if that's your thing. Next up, air dry on the second floor deck with a nice fence that allows for you to sun your buns in privacy. Finally, enjoy a nice big bedroom all night long and closets in the morning that will keep your wardrobe organized and wrinkle free.","num_images":22.0,"lat":39.943626,"lng":-75.168925,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '864ft2', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-04-01T10:12:39-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-quiet-stone-home-manayunk\/7465592028.html","post_id":7465592028,"result_date":"2022-04-01 10:28","title":"Quiet Stone Home Manayunk","description":"Bedrooms: 4\nBathrooms: 3\nLaundry: w\/d in unit\nParking: off-street parking\nMANAYUNK: 4 bedroom 3 bath 3 story Quiet Stone Home, washer and dryer yard basement $1300\nshow contact info","num_images":0.0,"lat":40.0402,"lng":-75.2231,"attrs":"['4BR \/ 3Ba', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking']","posted_date":"2022-04-01T10:13:38-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-lovely-passyunk-bedroom\/7465584413.html","post_id":7465584413,"result_date":"2022-04-01 10:28","title":"A Lovely Passyunk 3 bedroom 2 plus bathroom","description":"Housing Type: House\nBedrooms: 3\nBathrooms: 2+\nLaundry: w\/d in unit\nParking: off-street parking\nPASSYUNK: 3 bedroom, 2+ bath 2 story house a pristine place that has a huge rooftop deck, patio basement yard dining room $1450\nshow contact info","num_images":0.0,"lat":39.9362,"lng":-75.1563,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2Ba', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking']","posted_date":"2022-04-01T09:56:30-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-totally-renovated-plus\/7465579033.html","post_id":7465579033,"result_date":"2022-04-01 10:26","title":"Totally Renovated 2 plus bedroom","description":"Housing Type: House\nBedrooms: 2\nBathrooms: 2\nLaundry: w\/d in unit\nParking: attached garage\nART MUSEUM: Totally  Renovated 2 + bedroom and 2 bathroom!
