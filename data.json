Is off-street parking important? An updated kitchen and bath a must have? Get ready to check these all off your list! Welcome home to 208 Roberts Ave, a gorgeous bungalow that is nestled in the Fairoaks neighborhood of Horsham. The location can t be beat! Enjoy the peace and quiet of neighborhood living while being mere minutes from oodles of restaurants, shops, and easy access to major highways. This home is also located in a top rated school district! The beautiful sunroom is the perfect entrance into this lovely house. Enjoy all the natural light year round by setting this room up as a reading area or set up a bistro table and chairs for dining. The main living area has been completely opened up for those who desire an open floorplan. The hardwood floors have been nicely refinished with a darker stain that pops against the neutral walls (newer paint) and white trim. Recessed lights were added and there is plenty of room for the popular sectional sofa. The dining area nicely flows with the living room, making it easy to entertain family and friends. A dining table fits nicely under the modern chandelier and provides views overlooking the side yard. The kitchen is an absolute dream! Newer tile floors, white shaker cabinets, built-in pantry shelving, subway tile backsplash, recessed lighting, granite counters and crown molding complete the look. Stainless steel appliances include electric cook-top range, built-in microwave, dishwasher and fridge. We personally love the glass accent cabinets, ideal for those looking to showcase their favorite dishes. A breakfast bar was added for additional stool seating to enjoy a quick meal or a morning cup of coffee. Bedroom come complete with newer carpeting, ceiling fans and cedar closets. The bathroom was updated with newer floors, a shower\/tub combo and a subway tile accent shelf above the sink for toiletries. The large unfinished basements has a ton of potential! A private rear entrance leads to the basement and into the kitchen area. Currently the basement contains the laundry area with utility sink. There is rough-in plumbing for a bathroom to be added to the basement. If desired, the basement could be finished into the ultimate man cave, TV\/Media room, you name it! It also provides tons of storage space, which you can never have too much of! Parking isn t an issue with the massive detached two car garage. A separate shed is attached on the one side for additional storage space for lawn equipment or outdoor furniture. Inside the garage are additional rooms for more storage (or for a workshop) and stairs that lead up to the large unfinished loft (could be finished into a play room or a nice, private spot for a home office).
