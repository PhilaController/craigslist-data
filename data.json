My name is KRISTO! I used to live full time on the island! Many people know by my previous nursing care\/group home for the elderly business \u201cGentle Joy Elder Care\u201d .. I have twins that live on the island that I\u2019m planning on coming to visit in October. I\u2019m looking to rent a simple tent site in someone\u2019s backyard\u2026or on a person\u2019s land\u2026 To try to save money and be more economical\u2026 And I would be using the port for their bathroom and showers daily., so all I would need would be a 10 x 10 space to rest my head at night! I\u2019m willing to pay daily for the tent space! I have great references! :-) Many people know me especially the medical community on the island\u2026 I would greatly appreciate if you could either give me a call or email me that would be awesome! :-) I\u2019m coming from south Florida .. where I am a pro musician\/ pro dj! Here\u2019s my site: DjKristo.us I look forward to speaking with you and connecting! :-)60 year old drama free seeks a rental deal that includes shop space. Hi I'm a welder\/commercial fisherman and I'm looking at trying to find a rental deal that has a secured work area. I build custom trailers, truck beds and marine application projects as well as finish work on said projects and various wood constructed projects. I've been renting a room in Port Orchard which suited my needs initially but really isn't viable anymore since I can't work there. I have good credit. Good references and can pass a criminal history background check. Prefer rural near Shelton or close to there or around Port Townsend but am keeping all options open. What cha got? Let's talk... Scammers be aware I do not send personal information into the blind. I will not disclose any personal information until I've met \"the owner\" or property management representative in person at the physical location of said rental at which point I will accept all documentation germane to the process to complete then. If you're legit no big deal right?I\u2019m a local electrician in his early fifties still looking for a new place to hang my hat. I\u2019m single, no pets SMOKE FREE and quiet. I\u2019m seeking a rental scenario that would allow me to have a work area while keeping to myself. I\u2019ve opted to pursue the shared housing route while I figure out my next phase in life. Looking for at least a six month option, longer if things work out. I\u2019m a good roommate (early riser) and pay my rent on time. That being said I\u2019m dealing with medical collections due to a bout with cancer. I beat it but it kicked my butt. As a result my credit isn\u2019t good . NO evictions, currently residing in Springfield. Would prefer to stay close to work (within 20 minutes of Springfield). I do drive a transit van for work, it would be nice to have parking for it ( it\u2019s tall, off street?) On a personal note, I\u2019m pretty boring these days, not into partying ( not a big drinker) and such. Hobby wise I\u2019m into my motorcycle, RC models, sci fi ( really kinda a big nerd) . I enjoy a good steak , anything Asian cuisine , and make a mean pork loin on the BBQ. Like I mentioned before, mostly keep to myself these days, I have an adult daughter that may visit occasionally, not one for a lot of visitors. I\u2019m a Monday thru Friday guy, Up early , working full time ( and the some). Ideal situation would be a shop\/ mother in law suite, I\u2019m also good with traditional room for rent situations, just not looking for the usual \u201c we\u2019re thirty something\u2019s or prefer a traveling nurse\u201d like I see everywhere. I\u2019m handy and don\u2019t mind helping around the house but not interested in work trades. Have cash ready for deposits and such. Happy to discuss advance rent or larger deposits in lieu of credit score ( working on it but takes time) , feel free to reach out, nothin to hide If your looking for a stable , quiet, and mature tenant, let\u2019s talk JD Ps, if you respond , please include some info about your space, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of Spam replies, not going to waste my time or yours responding to a one line call me. I am also not going to offer my phone number without previous communication. I\u2019m amazed by all the spam I\u2019ve received. If you expect me to pay $800.00 a month plus the least you can do is introduce yourself , not just \u201c send me your number\u201d and \u201c You\u2019ll here from us soon\u201d.

The cat is currently living with my mom but I'd want to move her in within a month or two. About me, I work at a coffee shop about 33 hours a week, am quiet at home. I smoke cigarettes and 420 but I'll have no issue going outside for that. Would prefer a basement or attic room. Also close to a busline as I do not drive. I am currently homeless and living in a shelter but am working hard towards getting myself out of here and I'm really looking for a stable living condition for at least the next 6 months. Send an email if interested, and thank you!Hello I am wanting a room for 2 individuals or a place for 2. I believe in faith and the universe will lead me to the right place. I\u2019ve been struggling due to a lot of reasons and everything is so expensive but my credit went bad and it was hard to find a place. Since I kept getting rejected. I found a temporary room but it\u2019s not ideal at all so I'm looking for another room or place. If anyone is renting a room or if you just have an extra place no one is using etc would love to use it for short term until I get back in my feet. Aka paying off some student debt\/credit. I am a young adult and I\u2019m respectful of rules and like to keep to myself so don\u2019t take offense to me not being that social. I pray the right person finds this.Hello I\u2019ve made a post before but found a place temporarily. So I\u2019m posting this again because I would really want a better place that feels more comfortable and I\u2019m looking for roommates since everything is so expensive. I\u2019ve had plenty of roommates before. Good and bad ones. So after experiencing a lot I now know what type of roomies I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019ll talk a bit about myself. I like to keep to myself and pretty introverted,slightly spiritual, love books, music and shows, anime, nature etc. I have friends who are similar. I am looking for a roommate that is respectful, understands boundaries and can clean after themselves. I am semi quiet so looking for similar. I am wanting a 2 bedroom or 3 bedroom and would like to find good roommates to share with. Please have a job and reliable income. I don\u2019t mind moms who have kids but again I am looking for someone who is a little similar to me. If interested please email me and I\u2019m hoping good people find this who actually want to get a place together and won\u2019t flakeTwo long time friends, in our 50s, looking for long term house rental in Forest Grove or surrounding area, from Hillsboro to Banks, or beyond. Rural would be great. No apartments. No roommates. Place must have a garage or outbuilding for storage, and a small back yard. A\/C a plus, but not a deal breaker. IMPORTANT: We must give our current landlord 30 days notice, so no immediate move in offers, please. If you have a place coming available in the next few months, that would be perfect. At least 2 bed 2 bath (1.5 bath ok), but 3 bed ok. We don't need a lot of space, but the storage part is important. House preferred, but townhouse or duplex would work, if there's a small back yard and garage or storage shed. We don't park our cars ina garage, so it doesn't have to be huge. We currently live in Lafayette, but work in Forest Grove, and the commute is getting very expensive. Suzanne works in Newberg, but will transfer work closer to where we land. We don't have kids or pets, live quietly, and take care of the places we live. We are not a couple, so less complication there. Proof of income and references available. No evictions. If you're looking for responsible, adult tenants, we are those people. Please email Daniel at the Craigslist link. We can phone after that. I really dislike putting my number up on Craigslist, due to trolls and scammers.Guy desires RV space Oct. 1! (Sno. Cty or anywhere) - Whoever cancels me please think of my dog. He can't help it.
