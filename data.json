While summer days may seem far now, the private pool at Eaton Village is a wonderful plus during warm weather, as is the patio. Close to everything, and located within historic Chester County, Hersheys Mill has so much to offer, with its low-maintenance, carefree lifestyle a real draw. The parking spot and garage with man door are close to the home. From the front door, with a recently replaced storm door, the wood-floored foyer leads you into this lovely abode. The open-concept living room\/dining room area has a vaulted ceiling with a window, and a wood-burning fireplace for cozy cool evenings. Sliders lead to the private patio, with plenty of room for summer barbequing and entertaining. From the living room\/dining area, the recently improved kitchen is both pretty and wonderfully functional, with clean, white cabinets and Corian countertops, stainless steel appliances, and attractive wood floors. The charming breakfast area has a large window with a pretty view; the table and chairs are also available for sale with the home. A pantry closet allows for extra storage here as well. The main, carpeted bedroom is attractive, with lovely windows and two closets for plenty of storage. The main bath, recently renovated, has an oversized, step-in shower. The vanity is particularly eye-catching, with a marbled top and lots of drawers. The second bedroom, currently used as a den, is carpeted, with a nice closet and windows.
