It is a 3 room, 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom house. There is a large kitchen, and open living room and entry room. The basement is unfurnished. There's a backyard.\nThe house is aesthetically unique. It is not a new construction, it is a very well built home from the 1910s. Most of the house is exposed- brick, concrete & ceilings.\nThe place is furnished with everything seen in photos. Sofas, chairs, tables, beds, shelves, TV, desks, appliances, etc. Lots of storage is still available in the basement. Some space in the basement is dedicated to storing my stuff.\nThe neighborhood is beautiful. One can easily walk to downtown. There's also free street parking around, it is also a convenient commute to the Hospitals of Pennsylvania. There are many cafes, restaurants, and shops nearby...and a beer distributor one block away.\nThis is an energy efficient home, the gas line has been disconnected, therefore all heat and appliances are powered differently. I have an AC\/Heater minisplit unit downstairs that covers the 1st floor. There is also central air for the whole house. Each bedroom has wallmounted (electric) space heaters. The stove is connected to a propane tank, which with heavy use, needs refilling about every 6-9 months. The dryer is electric. This setup is different but ultimately leads to much cheaper energy\/bill costs.\nRenter would pay for electric bill and internet, in addition to cost of refilling propane tank. There is no gas bill and I will handle the water bill.\nPlease ask questions or inquire about any details, some things are negotiable, like which furniture needs to stay or if you want to replace the beds, so on and so on.
