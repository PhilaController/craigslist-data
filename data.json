The reason I am leaving this apartment is because I am moving in with another roommate for medical school, otherwise I would have stayed. The location is amazing, with a 1 minute to Jefferson campus and also very close to Penn Hospital. Other notable destinations such as Reading Terminal, Chinatown, Jefferson Station, & Patco Station are a short walk away. There are a great number of amazing restaurants nearby. Whole Foods and Acme are the local grocery stores and are only a 6 minute walk away.\nThe highlight of the apartment is its extremely high ceilings that make the space feel very airy. It was retrofitted with central heat and air. It is a first floor apartment with two giant windows towards the street but it is not very loud since Spruce is relatively quiet. The kitchen and bathroom were newly renovated and the rooms are nicely sized as well. There is a kitchen island and in-unit washing machine and dryer.\nPlease include your name, phone number, and the best time for us to schedule a showing in your response.
