Rents are getting close to double what they were before the pandemic, with studios and 1beds cracking 1k, 2 bedrooms going for ~$1500 and 3 bedrooms going close to 2k, even past 52nd Street. What could be the motive other than pushing people out who can't afford these price hikes? What happens when the taxes in these areas rise with the cost of living, forcing lifelong Philadelphians out of our homes? This is a reminder that we are the market. We don't have to accept landlords price gouging. Even if you think you can afford it, it's unacceptable for the average salary in Philly to be  ~30k range and for anyone to be paying half their wages on rent. Stick together and let's get these prices back down to something reasonable or we'll all be struggling to make ends meet.
