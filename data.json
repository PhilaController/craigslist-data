This home is uniquely situated on extra wide lot (16 x 70), which creates larger, more useable living space not only inside but also outside. Prepare to be wowed when you step into the sunny open concept living, dining and kitchen space with its gleaming mid-tone hardwood floors and high ceilings. This space is thoughtfully laid out with plenty of room for large scale living room furniture and a full dining set. There is even a powder room smartly tucked away between the kitchen and dining spaces. The kitchen is a classic style with solid wood cabinetry, gleaming black granite countertops, a neutral tile backsplash, stainless steel appliances (including a gas range!) and a large suburban-sized pantry closet. There is a double window over kitchen sink that provides a bird\u2019s eye view into the back yard space and allows daytime sunlight to fill the kitchen area. The back door is right off the kitchen and provides convenient access to a large outdoor space with ample room for lounging and dining al fresco. There is a dedicated square of soil ready to go for you to plant a summer garden. Upstairs, you'll find two good-sized bedrooms and a generously sized full bathroom. The main bedroom is light and airy with two tall southern facing windows that let in plenty of sun to showcase the room. Inside the main bedroom there is also two closets and a separate, smaller closet \u201ccubby\u201d that is the perfect space for shoe storage if you are channeling your inner organizer. This bedroom is really the perfect, cozy spot to Netflix and chill on a Saturday night. The second bedroom is spacious with a full size closet. The main bathroom features walk-in shower with frameless glass doors, jetted tub for soaking and a double vanity with modern-style vessel sinks. Outside of this bathroom, there are two hall closets for extra storage. Downstairs, the basement is a big bonus with its nicely finished additional living space complete with a powder room. There is also a large, dry storage space complete with shelving to keep things organized in the basement separate from the finished area. The Kenmore washer and dryer are in this space. Another bonus, this block of Christian Street is usually an easy spot to street park, a rarity in Graduate Hospital! This home is truly nestled in the perfect location. In just a few minutes you could walk to Sidecar for brunch, Loco Pez for dinner or even head to any of the restaurants in Rittenhouse Square! In the summer months you are just a few blocks away from swimming at the City\u2019s beautiful O\u2019Connor Pool. It is also an easy walk to shopping at Heirloom Market and along the South Street corridor, greenspace at Schuylkill River Park and Fitler Square Park with its seasonal farmers market.
