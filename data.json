I'm trying to move to Los Angeles to go to school for music and to continue pursuing my music career. My friends would describe me as Kindhearted, Funny, hardworking, and sympathetic. In my free time, I like to work on music\/career stuff, talk to friends, and relax in my room. On the weekends, you'll normally find me cleaning up and washing my hair or going out to explore\/hang out with some friends. Since I am new to LA I'm shooting to move soon so I can get myself settled with a job and everything before school starts. I have money saved up to hold me for at least 2 months. I'm hoping to find a house near Icon collective college of music in Burbank, CA.\n\"\n","num_images":4,"lat":39.9597,"lng":-75.2024,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 3Ba', '1200ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-07-15T09:27:02-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/woodlyn-looking-for-1-bedroom\/7509026248.html","post_id":7509026248,"result_date":"2022-07-15 09:30","title":"Looking for a 1 Bedroom?","description":"Schedule a Tour!\nBook an appointment online at 2tour.site\/3IP\/N5K0\n\nWallingford Estates Apartments offers a relaxing atmosphere that allows you a peaceful alternative to your hectic, daily schedule.

I'm grad student in my mid-20s looking for a room in the $650-$900 ish range for this upcoming school year (Aug-May) or semester (Aug-Jan). I have great credit, some provable income and a guarantor if needed as well.\nMy classes are in Downtown Brooklyn so something easily accessible to there by bus or train would be ideal. Crown Heights, Clinton Hill, Bed-Stuy, PLG, etc. I am very flexible with location though if you are a little more out there still hmu.\nI am very clean, quiet and will mostly be out at school, work or events. I am not much of a party animal and don't drink so when I do go out at night I tip toe straight to my room. An ideal home would be 420 friendly as but I can adapt if that is not ideal. I am queer and brown so roommates must be tolerant of that.\nThat is about it from me! If you have a spot and would like more information or social media links from me feel free to shoot me an e-mail, I check it v regularly. If you do contact me pls share a little bit about the room, apartment and roommates.\n\n","num_images":4,"lat":39.9379,"lng":-75.1794,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 1Ba', '1138ft2', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-07-15T08:49:26-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-unit-is-by-the-corner-of\/7509023519.html","post_id":7509023519,"result_date":"2022-07-15 09:01","title":"unit is by the corner of girard ave","description":"This beautiful 2bed\/1,5 bath bi level unit is by the corner of girard ave and front street has all the luxurious amenities that you're looking for in this awesome location.
