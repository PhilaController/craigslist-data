I made a quick stop on 4\/3 and noticed the following issues. (1) paint on some kitchen cabinet fronts are chipping away. I'll be researching on how to repair them since Ikea has changed its product design and they cannot be replaced with doors from the new line. (2) tenant didn't install AC properly two years ago and it caused some water damage on the wall below a window. Some paint work may be needed there. (3) tenant broke the medicine cabinet glass door - looking to see how it can be replaced with a close matched door.

The historic Western Union Building featuring Beaux Arts style of the time, was originally built 100 years ago as the headquarters of Western Union Telegraph Company, and was beautifully and tastefully expanded and redesigned  into a luxury 12- story boutique residence by Philadelphia's renowned architect Cecile Baker in 2008.
