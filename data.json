Well here is a chance to get a birds eye view of the world in the heart of University City. Huge One bedroom apartment with an extra room that can be curtained off or used as a den. The apartment has tons of gorgeous natural light. There are six closets in the apartment so it has a lot of storage. Hardwood floors through out. Balcony overlooking the corner of 48th and Cedar.\nNew kitchen with granite countertops, subway tile, and appliances. Garage disposal too.\nThe apartment is a mother-in-law suite, which means you go through the owners house to get to the apartment. Because of that, we are being really careful who we rent to. We would prefer a couple or single person, who loves their own space, but will respect our space as they go through. No parties are allowed. The rent is lower than normal for this size apartment.\nCats are ok, but no dogs. We have a dog though so you must like dogs.\nThere is a Washer and Dryer in the building. Tenants pay electrical and gas. Gas bill is only for the stove.\nThis apartment is a block from Baltimore Avenue, 4 blocks from Clark Park, a block from Mariposa Grocery store, Local Pez, Gold Standard, and near many restaurants and bars. Its a great family friendly neighborhood with large trees.\nCall Mike to set up an appointment.

The third floor has spacious master bedroom with a king bed, a full bathroom with both a bathtub and a frameless glass shower surround, and a third bedroom (currently being used as a nursery) with another private balcony. There are two skylights that let in lots of natural light. Our basement is finished and has a large-screen TV and a sofa-bed. We have a 4 year old daughter so there are plenty of toys and lots of children's furniture (we can put this in storage if you don\u2019t need it).\nWe absolutely love our neighborhood, and you will too! It is filled with academics, doctors, and other professionals, and is very child friendly.  There are several grocery stores, restaurants, shops, schools, parks, and playgrounds nearby.
