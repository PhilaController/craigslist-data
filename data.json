Historic beautiful original architecture and finishes with an incredible vibe. You don't find properties like this anymore very often. A GEM!  TONS of Street parking available.\nThis would be a truly great home for a family with children, which the owners would love! Or a couple that works from home with rooms for separate private offices. We are looking for a tenant that is the right fit. If you are interested in playing super loud music or parties...this is not the right spot for you.\nCigarette smoker or have pets, unfortunately also not for you. If you are interested in a quiet building, for a great rental price for the size of this historic building and amazing neighborhood then this could be the right spot for you. The owners have owned the building since the 70s\/80s and fond of the arts and care very much about the Powelton Village community.\nYou will not be renting from a management company or non caring landlords. They care about finding the right fit for a tenant for their unique building.\nSo please provide a bit about your story. Why are you interested in the house? Tell us a bit about yourself? What do you do with your time? Do you work or go to school? How many people will be occupying the building? The owners would like to limit this property's occupancy ideally to a single family unit or someone who can afford to rent the house as a sole entity. For wear and tear, and avoiding \"this roommate can't pay\" this month situations. It happens.\nThe owners would love to provide the opportunity for a home with one of the best Philadelphia public elementary schools, behind Penn Alexander.\nThe owners do not work with brokers \/ or pay co op commissions. I am not a listing agent this listing is posted on the behalf of older non technology savvy owners. * Pets considered on a case by case basis!

The abundance of square footage creates a perfect living space for a big family or for roommates - there's not just a front staircase but there is also a rear staircase accessible from the kitchen that leads up to the bedrooms on the 2nd floor. More about that in a second. In this large straight-through style home, there's much sunlight that comes through the enclosed porch, then enter the living room through a French-style door. Living room has ample space and a coat closet. Past the living room is a dining room, then the kitchen. Kitchen is roomy enough to eat in. Back door off the kitchen goes out to the REAR DECK! This deck is great for bbq'ing, reading in peace, catching a breeze, or hanging out. Now head up that rear staircase off the kitchen to find the 4 bedrooms spaced out along the very long hallway. There is also a spacious hall closet located right outside of the large and airy bathroom. The bathroom has 2 storage\/linen closets, a full tub with shower and a brand new skylight. The basement has tons of storage space, a half bathroom (toilet and sink) as well as a washer and dryer for laundry. Although this home has a garage, it is not included in the rental.

KITCHEN is in the rear with updated cabinets, solid butcher block, dishwasher, disposal, classic subway tile backsplash and great lighting. BACKYARD is cozy with a covered porch big enough for dining and entertaining. 2ND FLOOR: Front large bedroom with great light and closet. 2nd Bedroom off hallway has a good sized closet and window facing out to the rear yard. BATH on 2nd Floor is lovely with all new ceramic fixtures, tub, and tile. BASEMENT is a great size for storage, music or craft, with good ceiling height, full laundry set-up, and an extra half-bathroom. This is one of the best locations Fishtown has to offer - a close walk to all the best spots on Frankford Avenue (Suraya, La Colombe etc) or Girard Avenue, and the Historic Palmer Burial Ground is at the end of the block. Close to public trans (bus and train) for a quick commute to center city and close to the interstate for easy access to Northeast Phila, South Phila, Bucks County, Delaware and NJ.
