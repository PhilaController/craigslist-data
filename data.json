All the appliances are sized to be used and enjoyed (read: no dorm room sized refrigerator, for instance) and although a laundromat is a couple blocks away, you won't need to round up quarters because the dual washer\/dryer will handle that! The first floor also boosts a little outside nook for when you need to get air without sitting on a stoop and to grow your fresh herbs or whatever you prefer! A snazzy spiral staircase takes you up to the second floor where your queen sized bed, flat screen TV and nicely updated bathroom await you. Don't want to take the spiral route? For those long days when you just need to crash, you can bypass that and take the staircase in the foyer right to your second floor door. It could not be more convenient! As for the location? Groceries, restaurants, entertainment, transportation.... just EVERYTHING is right outside the door! Here you can have the best of both worlds; a beautiful, cozy, quiet furnished home on the inside and a city rich in culture and diversity with convenience galore on the outside.
