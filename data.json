Send me a message with some basic information about you and your family, I will get back to you.\nNO PETS!\nAvailable August 1, 2022 is this cozy 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom single family house for rent in downtown Palmerton, PA, zip code 18071. The house has about 900 SF of interior area, a small front entry porch, and a small attached deck at the back entrance. The tenant has the use of a 16 x16 elevated deck which is directly behind the house, which has an amazing view of the Blue Mountains and the Appalachian Trail and a gas grill. This deck is shared space. The house was fully remodeled 7 years ago or so, and everything is in excellent shape. All the major appliances are included, such as washer\/dryer, air conditioner which is built into the wall, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, and electric range. Water\/sewer\/trash is paid by the owner, and the tenant pays electric and cable\/internet, and landline phone if needed. The heat is electric baseboard, so there is no oil or gas bill to worry about. 1 off street parking space is included, with a second space available for a small car at $75 per month in addition to the base rent. There are also spaces in the street if necessary. There are lots of stairs, and the parking area is not directly in front of the house, so if you are mobility impaired please keep that in mind. It is a good vibe in an inclusive community where everyone pitches in and gets along. The property includes a 3 acre mountain side covered with boulders and trees, which you can explore and enjoy to your heart's content. You are walking distance to the Palmerton Park, and to all of downtown Palmerton. Owner lives next door. The house is located very near the entrance to Palmerton from route 248. It is less than 15 minutes to the new St. Luke's Carbon Hospital Campus, and about the same distance to the new Lehigh Valley Hospital which is opening soon in Lehighton. It is about 10 minutes to the entrance to Route 476, the Pennsylvania turnpike, if you need to access that regularly. To get to the house you take the route 248 exit into Palmerton, you would then make the first left onto Mauch Chunk Road, and the house is located about 1\/4 mile on the right side. The only outside work you need to do is snow removal during the winters, since the owner takes care of all spring\/summer\/fall exterior maintenance.\nThe owner is an experienced landlord and only accept tenants who can pass the screening process with ease. Requirements are as follows: - Gross pay of 3 times the monthly rent (combined if applying jointly) - 3 months of pay stubs (proof of income) - Phone number of immediate supervisor to verify employment - Full Credit report (score is not necessary) - Criminal Background Check and eviction report - If available, phone numbers of previous landlords and copies of previous leases. - If no previous landlords are available, then 2 personal references who are not family members. Send me a message about yourself, and I will get back to you.
