This 3 bedroom 1.5 Bath twin is on a diverse and family friendly tree-lined street. The house would be ideal for a young family and is in Cheltenham School District.

Upstairs there are 3 bedrooms and a full bathroom (freshly painted) with claw foot tub. Lots of storage in the attic which can be accessed via pull down steps. 1 car garage has been converted into a small workshop and has power but no heat (not big enough to park a car inside).\nOutside: Small front covered porch which looks over the garden.
