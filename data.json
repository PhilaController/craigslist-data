The first thing you notice as you step into this center city loft is the dramatic height of the two stories high ceiling. The second thing might be the expansive wall of windows spanning the entire south exposure of the living spaces. The third could be the beautiful, original form from the days this building was a factory, freshly re-varnished maple hardwood floors. A few steps further into the center of the unit and it is the slate tiled fireplace with oversized stone hearth that catches your eye. Imagine yourself sitting there cozying up next to a warm wood burning fire this winter. Turn yourself around and look to the other end of the condo and you\u2019ll see the dining area with a gorgeous modern chandelier and rustic dining table capable of seating for ten people. A reclaimed wall hutch adds the charm of the dining nook. The kitchen is equipped with a soapstone countertop and a river rock backsplash. There are maple wood cabinets to compliment the floors and stainless steel appliances, including an under counter wine refrigerator. Turning around again and looking behind the fireplace are two large rooms, one stacked on top of the other and both with built-in bookshelves and impressively large walk-in closets. Use one as a bedroom and the other a den, or both bedrooms. The bathroom has been customized with an extra deep soaking tub, dual flushing toilet, vanity cabinet and warming towel rack. Being on the top floor of the building there is easy access to the brand new community rooftop deck. This space expands your enjoyment and entertaining space to the outdoors where you can enjoy panoramic views of Philadelphia\u2019s skyline.","num_images":10.0,"lat":39.95919,"lng":-75.158921,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '1146ft2', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-06-17T21:07:33-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/horsham-this-move-in-ready-bedroom\/7633781382.html","post_id":7633781382,"title":"This move in ready 1 bedroom.","description":"This move in ready 1 bedroom (ceiling fans in both rooms), 1 bathroom in the full bathroom there is a heat lamp for those Winter mornings.
