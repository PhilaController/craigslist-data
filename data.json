It's just a couple blocks away from the many shops and restaurants on the Baltimore Ave. corridor.\nFrom the tree-lined street, you walk up onto your porch -- one that's large enough for a dining table or an outdoor sofa and chairs. From here, the front door will take you into a small mudroom before you walk into your living room where you'll find 10-foot-high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a fireplace. In the front of the living room is a giant picture window and on the side is a bay window with a built-in window seat. Walking through the living room and past the powder room, you'll head into the dining room where the hardwood floors and 10-foot-high ceilings continue. Here you'll find another bay window and a built-in glass-fronted china closet. Past the dining room is the kitchen, which includes a dishwasher and new refrigerator. The kitchen has two doors. One that leads to the basement where you'll find more storage space than you'll ever need as well as your washer and dryer. The other door leads out to your private back porch and back yard, which also has an additional deck large enough for a dining table and an outdoor living room set up.\nAs you head back through the kitchen and dining room and up the stairs, you'll find three bedrooms and a full bathroom on the second floor. The ceilings on this floor are also ten feet high. The primary bedroom is enormous, has a bay window overlooking the beautiful trees on 48th street. It also has a fireplace. The other two bedrooms have a slightly odd configuration (railroad): In order to access one, you have to walk through the other. (Because of this, the home would probably not be a good set up for three roommates). All bedrooms have good sized closets and two have bay windows. The unit is cooled with a central air system and has additional mini splits that can add heat or add cooling in the upstairs rooms.\nThe way this home is set up, it feels like you'll be living in a victorian twin that you have all to yourself. However, there is a third floor apartment that has a long-term tenant who is a lovely person. The entrance to her third-floor apartment is on the side of the house in the alley. She does not share an entrance with you and does not have use of either of the porches or the backyard.\nThere is plenty of street parking. 90% of the time you can find parking on your block without having to look. The other 10% of the time, it won't take you longer than 2 minutes to look for parking and you'll never have to park more than 2 blocks away.\nThe landlords are a lesbian couple who lived in this unit. The photos are from when we lived in the unit a year and a half ago, so the decor looks different now that tenants are living in the unit. Be aware that when you come to see the unit, it will look different than these photos because the house will have the current tenants' furniture and decor. The unit is being rented unfurnished.\nIn our opinion, the location is perfect. In one direction, you are two blocks away from the heart of the Baltimore corridor where you will find the Gold Standard Cafe, the Mariposa Co-Op, Vietiene Cafe, and many salons and shops. In the other direction, you are three blocks away from ReAnimator Coffee, the 48th Street Grille, and the shops on the Spruce Street Corridor. Turn in another direction and you're only 5 blocks from Clark Park, and in the final direction you're only four blocks from Dock Street Brewery. You won't find a more perfect location in West Philly.\nIf you are interested in seeing the unit, please respond via email. Tell us a bit about you, what your target move-in date is, and ask any questions that you have. Showings will not begin until November 8th.\nSome pets may be considered with an additional fee.\n","num_images":9.0,"lat":39.950273,"lng":-75.218833,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 1.5Ba', '1800ft2', 'available jan 1, 2023', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-11-01T21:09:28-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/7552586816.html","post_id":7552586816,"result_date":"2022-11-01T23:46:53.000Z","title":"Now Leasing 2 & 3 Bedrooms - Steps Away From Train Station & Downtown","description":"Now Leasing: 2 & 3 Bedrooms From $1002 -$1101\/mo - Act Now & Apply Today\nThe Willows at Elmwood Gardens\n100 Harlan Drive\nCoatesville, PA 19320\nshow contact info\nwww.willowsatelmwoodgardens.com\nRENT:\n2 & 3 Bedroom From $1002 -$1101\/mo*\n*Note: Income restrictions apply.
