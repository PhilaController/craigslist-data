The house has basement storage with a spare bathroom and a roofdeck, central air and heating. The roommates are leaving at different times, one shooting for mid May and the other shooting for mid June, so there is some flexibility with move in dates. I'm hoping to have the lease signed by the end of April.\nAbout me: bartender and writer, I generally spend most of my time in my room or at work and only have more than one person over maybe once a month, if that. But I do keep a well stocked home bar and kitchen so I'm onboard for reasonably sized gatherings. I have two cats, both very friendly and sociable and mostly just follow me around but if they like you they might hang out with you while I'm not around. They get into mild scuffles sometimes but I'm fairly certain they'd be fine with another cat, which the landlord would need to approve.\n","num_images":11.0,"lat":39.942826,"lng":-75.158629,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 3.5Ba', 'available may 15', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-03-20T19:03:34-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/ambler-beautiful-bedroom-bath-townhouse\/7601458856.html","post_id":7601458856,"title":"Beautiful 3 Bedroom, 2 1\/2 Bath Townhouse For Rent!","description":"Amazing opportunity to rent this \"brand new\" 3 bedroom, 2.5 bath, end unit townhome in the ever popular Stuart Creek Farms.
