The photographs will tell the story but it is when you see it in person that you will truly fall in love!! The main floor, with its beautiful hardwood floors, flow from the Living Room into the Dining Room and then to the Kitchen. The creative use of floor to ceiling barn doors create a moveable wall for an intimate dining experience. The kitchen is a home chef's delight- upgraded waterfall countertops and backsplash add to the high-end designer touch. Even the powder room is magazine worthy! The 2nd floor main bedroom is quite spacious with hardwood floors, walk-in closet and remodeled en-suite bath with ceramic floor, duel vanity and gorgeous lighting! 2 additional bedrooms and the 2nd 'designer' bath complete the 2nd floor. The showstoppers to this property are the outdoor living spaces and lower-level entertainment room! The homeowners created a true oasis of not just 1 but 2 outdoor living rooms - the upper composite deck off of the kitchen, provides space for dining and lounging. Stairs from this deck lead down into the fully-fenced, landscaped and private yard. The owners spared no expense in having the yard re-graded and built-up to create level yard space! The lower 'deck', is a cool, hip space for family and friends to hang-out! The symbiotic rhythm between the lower outside entertainment space flows seamlessly into the lower level family room! This is an exceptional space featuring a wet bar, living space, exercise area\/play space or what ever your creative mind sees fit! The laundry room, storage room and mechanicals are also located on this level.","num_images":4,"lat":40.3886,"lng":-75.9328,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 3Ba', '1798ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-07-24T20:13:35-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/southjersey.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/sewell-condo-for-rent\/7512976629.html","post_id":7512976629,"result_date":"2022-07-24 20:53","title":"Condo for Rent","description":"This is a 2 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom, \u201cmove in ready\u201d condo with 1,115 sq feet in Marlton, NJ.
