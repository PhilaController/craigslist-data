This building has been thoughtfully designed, from the interior of the units to the boutique gym and welcoming entryway.

It offers a variety of spacious units including 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, and studio options, allowing you to experience quintessential urban living.\nThe units feature floor-to-ceiling windows that flood the space with natural light and showcase the rich hickory hardwood floors. The modern kitchens come in a range of finishes including black, navy blue, and white, with quartz countertops and fingerprint-resistant black stainless steel Samsung appliances, adding a touch of style. The in-unit stacked washer\/dryers, central heating and cooling, and Energy-Star appliances make living easy and convenient.\nThe building is secured with gated entry points throughout, managed by the ButterflyMx system, ensuring safety and security. A package locker is also available to keep your packages safe while you're out. Two elevators and additional storage in the basement, including bike storage, make it even more convenient. You can access the full gym and yoga space 24 hours a day!\nIn addition to the residential units, there are two commercial tenants, including Wag Days, a doggy daycare, trainer, and overnight boarder, providing a convenient option for pet owners.\nThe Bromley Loom House is conveniently located near the Market-Frankford line, making it easy to get to all access points for seamless daily transit. You'll see the modern matte black brick building with patinaed Corten steel gleaming like a beacon above the train, adding a touch of urban sophistication to the drone of new construction facades surrounding it.\nOverall, the Bromley Loom House offers a modern and convenient living experience, paying tribute to the neighborhood's rich history while providing all the amenities you need for comfortable living.\nPet fees apply.\nCommercial amenities just steps away:\n\u2022\tRowhome Coffee\n\u2022\tForin Caf\u00e9\n\u2022\tWag Days\n\u2022\tMartha Bar\n\u2022\tZig Zag\n\u2022\tPhiladelphia Brewing\n\u2022\tMonkey Club\n\u2022\tMural City Winery\n\u2022\tEvil Genius\n\u2022\tLMNO\n\u2022\t700 Club\n\u2022\tGoldie\n\u2022\tInternational Bar\n\u2022\tMiddle Child Clubhouse\n\u2022\tTired Hands St. Oner's\n\u2022\tCheu and Nunu\n\u2022\tWm.

Philly Apt Close to Everything!","description":"Available early May, potentially May 1st.\nThis is a well-maintained 1 bedroom apartment on South Broad Street between Reed and Wharton.  It is in a quiet, non-smoking, mostly owner-occupied building (other units are only 1 bedroom as well).\nThe apartment is located on the 2nd floor, in one of the quieter spaces in the building, farther from Broad Street's traffic and subway line; the bedroom is in the back of the unit, even farther.\nThe apartment features bamboo flooring throughout, with the exception of the recently renovated bathroom.  There are high (10 and 11 ft) ceilings in the living room and bedroom and large windows in both, making the space seem considerably larger than the actual footprint of the apartment.\nThe living\/dining room has large and interesting windows, crown molding and a powerful ceiling fan.\nThe kitchen has an electric stove (4 burners) and garbage disposal.  Both the dishwasher and refrigerator are less than 5 years old.\nThe bathroom was completely gutted and renovated two years ago, and it now features new subway tiling on the walls, porcelain flooring, a newer shower stall, built in storage, a handheld showerhead, a dual-flush toilet, and updated lighting.\nThe bedroom is very large and could easily accommodate a king sized bed. There are 2 closets, with additional storage above them.  There is a newer high powered ceiling fan as well.\nThe unit is heated with radiators very effectively.  This heat is turned on building-wide, usually after the very first frost, meaning that a tenant will have to wait until the first frost to get heat out of those radiators.  A tenant will not receive an individual gas bill for this heat; I simply charge $300 ($25\/month) for the entire season.\nHeat also comes from the electric, ductless units located high on the walls in both the living room and bedroom.  These units produce both heating and cooling via remote and do not require the use of a window.  They are extremely efficient, quiet and give flexibility not found in a central A\/C system.  A tenant can heat or cool one space (like the bedroom at night) without having to simultaneously cool the living room, ultimately saving money and energy.\nThe hot water heater is less than 3 years old.\nWhile the apartment does not have a washer and dryer in the unit itself, there is FREE use of a washer (pretty new) and a dryer (also newer) in the basement.  BYO detergent only.  Because the building is so small (and some units do have their own washers and dryers), there is a rarely a line for access to these facilities.\nThe apartment is on 1 of the few blocks of S. Broad Street not requiring a parking permit, and street parking (both sides of Broad and the middle) is usually easy to find.  A tenant would just need to move their vehicle for street cleaning one day a week during the warmer months.\nThe location of the apartment is hard to beat, especially for South Philly.  It is 1.5 blocks from 2 subway stops and multiple bus lines.  Passyunk Square itself is 2 blocks away.  It is a 9 minute walk to multiple grocery stores (ACME & Sprouts), a 12 minute walk to the Italian Market and less than 15 minutes to the stores and restaurants of East Passyunk, one the best commercial stretches in the city.  The Broad Street Run occurs right outside the building's front doors, and neighbors line the streets to cheer on the participants.  In past years, the Mummers have rehearsed and warmed-up along this stretch of Broad as well.\nRent is $1175 ($1150 rent + $25 for radiator heat).\nA tenant would be responsible for first and last months' rent, along with a security deposit (which would NOT have the $25 heat payment).  I provide water, but a tenant covers gas (hot water only, not radiator heat) electric and cable\/internet.\nThere is no application or application fee associated with this apartment.  I'll call a reference you give me, ask to look at a paystub or two, and walk you through the terms of our lease.\nCats permitted with a nominal fee and pet deposit.","num_images":11.0,"lat":39.933368,"lng":-75.167942,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '525ft2', 'available may 1', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-03-11T12:27:56-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-spacious-and-one-of-the\/7598163773.html","post_id":7598163773,"title":"Spacious and One of the Best Apartment Buildings in Philadelphia!!","description":"The Metropolitan apartments in Center City, Philadelphia stand tall in the center of Philadelphia's historic skyline.
