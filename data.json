Further back, the home gives way to voluminous vaulted ceilings in a grand living room space, where huge 7 ft windows & transoms let the sunlight in. One side is anchored by a full wall of built-in shelving and cabinet storage, complete with media hook up, while the other hosts a bar area with walnut countertop seating, pendant lighting, and a door to the floating deck - perfect for having friends and family over. The deck floats at the back corner of the home, offering a buffer on two sides and great views from there of the large, level, green backyard. Quietly tucked away down a hall beyond the dining room, Custom trim, CAT 6 wired,. and hard wired security system throughout. Spacious, airy, welcoming, and done with style - this home has it all!
