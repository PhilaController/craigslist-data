I\u2019m a hard working person I had to come back to Oregon because my mom is on hospice. Yet I have to live in my car. Any affordable leads would be appreciated.\nHello Portland! My name is Monica. I recently got to Portland after 9 years abroad teaching English and studying Eastern Culture (I love India and Nepal!). I also spent a few years in Mexico. Hablo espanole si quieres practicar conmigo! Mi espanole no es lo mejor pero podemos practicar! :) If you rent me a room I will give you unlimited free Spanish lessons. Bring your friends! Free for everyone. My story is weird. I am supposed to be in Buenos Aires finally starting my English school\/ art gallery for marginalized communities, but I had to return to the USA for a dental implant! I had a bad horseback accident a year ago, my front tooth was knocked clean out! I am in Portland to get good quality medical care. It is the ONLY reason I am in the USA. The process will take about one year, as the healing periods between surgeries are super long. I would not be a bedridden smelly sad sack in your house though, the facial swelling only lasts a week after each surgery. In a year, I will have my magic teeth and can leave this rotting land of avarice. My first surgery will be in a few weeks. I am still teaching online, will be getting a job at a shelter soon. After 5 continents and 30 countries, I have never been anywhere as dynamically and needlessly tragic as Portland. So much suffering, so many people lost in a broken system. And a general populace that claims impotence. C'mon y'all, this is downright shameful. This country has gone to total shit, legal weed is cool though. During some post op healing periods, I will not be working. My father can personally guarantee that my rent will be paid, and he would be happy to talk with a prospective renter on the phone. He is paying for all rent I cannot cover and all rent\/medical for the coming year. I love teaching, yoga, fitness, meditation, books, hiking, camping and sometimes 420. Not much drinking anymore, never wasted. I must admit I am a psychonaut (every few months or so to gain perspective). I am fairly solitary and aside from art projects and lots of adventures, I am usually reading. I would be happy to rent a room, garage, trailer (I mean, tiny house. Sorry Portland, haha) I would even be happy to rent a tent space in your back yard! I can pay up to 900 per month for whatever I end up renting. I have not driven in 17 years and don't plan on it. I skateboard and bicycle a lot though. Hello! Middle aged who is employed full time looking for a long term platonic non furnished room for rent.
