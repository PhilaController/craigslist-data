Original Trinities had one room on each floor. This house has TWO rooms on each floor + a deck off the 2nd floor bedroom.\n\"Philadelphia \"Trinity\" Houses: Built 1703-1836 to house tradesmen and artisans, these small brick structures were built in the Georgian and Federal-style along a cobblestone street. The name trinity refers to the three-story vertical structure connected by a spiral staircase.\"\nSears Street @ S 3rd Street (very close to E Moyamensing Ave)\nPennsport \/ South Philly \/ Queen Village Adjacent, Philadelphia\nThis classic Philadelphia \"trinity\" house was COMPLETELY RENOVATED. Finishes are high-end and upscale. Important foundational components have been addressed too; there's a recently-installed roof, deck and paved backyard patio. Location? It's excellent! You're really close & equidistant from South Street and the Italian Market. So if you like biking or walking, this house is an excellent fit. Otherwise, there's lots of on-street parking immediately accessible.\nMonthly Rent: $1695 for leases starting on or November 16\nUtilities: Gas, Electric & Water on your own meters.\nLease: 1 year lease required w\/detailed agreement.\nMove-in: 1st month, last month + security.\nPets: Cat OK (and maybe a small dog) with pet addendum & fee.\nExterior Front: Steel front door with privatized leaded-glass detail. All front windows have been \"capped\" to reduce drafts. New house number, front light and railing.\nLiving Room: Enter directly into the compact living room featuring newly installed recessed lighting. There's a built-in closet directly ahead for storage. You can't miss the beautiful Caribbean Pine flooring. It starts at the front door and continues. . .\nKitchen: . . .into the kitchen. The entire first floor has hardwood flooring. On the way into the kitchen, you'll see the entrance to the basement (and stairs to the 2nd floor) to your left. A modern Italian-tiled \"feature\" wall wraps around the right-side entrance to the kitchen and faces the kitchen door. The kitchen cabinets are bright white w\/stainless trimming and handles. Mini-subway tiles and black glass serve as the backsplash above a black granite countertop. Modern appliances including a compact dishwasher and gas stove.\nPatio\/Backyard: The backyard was dug out to uncover a ground drain, then completely resurfaced. The back wall has been painted. A new wooden fence was installed on the west side of the patio, including a gate leading to a side walkway to the front street (great for taking out trash and storing your bike).\nBathroom (2nd floor): Original circular wood stairs lead up to 2nd floor hall w\/original hardwood plank flooring. Full bathroom at the front of the house with upgraded fixtures. . . even the bathtub. The bathtub \"surround\" is completely tiled with white marble. More modern Italian porcelain tile on the floor. Full-glass medicine cabinet and modern vanity. Chrome bath hardware.\nBedroom (2nd floor): Our contractor installed unique random-width plank flooring including all American hardwoods -- white oak, red oak, hickory and cherry. There's a built-in closet for clothing. A sliding fabric-panel system opens to reveal a large deck exclusively accessible from this bedroom.\nThird floor: Climb another set of circular steps to the top floor, where you'll find a second bedroom w\/new exotic-wood laminate flooring. The ceiling is super high, with painted beam struts and modern glass and stainless fixtures. There's another small room on the third floor, too -- great as a computer room, home office, extra large walk-in closet, etc.\nBasement: Unfinished with your own washer & dryer + storage space!\nLocation, location, location:\nLocation is excellent.
