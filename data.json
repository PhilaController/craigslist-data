Through the front door, you'll find a large closet and entryway that opens up into what we've used as a dining room. Just off the dining room is a quaint kitchen equipped with an oven, microwave, dishwasher, refrigerator, and ample cabinet space. The large living room has lots of natural light as well as a beautiful view. This room was large enough to double as a home office and living room.\nBack through the dining room, you'll find a hallway that leads to 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. We used the smaller bedroom as a spare room, office, and musical space and this space also has a large closet for extra storage, a ceiling fan, and great natural light. Further down the hallway is a small bathroom with a full size bathtub and shower. The 2nd and final bedroom is slightly larger than the 1st and has a large closet, room for multiple dressers, queen sized bed, and views of both the city skyline and a neighboring church.\nThis unit is on the 4th floor of the building and is accessible by both elevator and stairs. Access to the shared roof deck with 360 degree views is right next to this unit, and you'll often find dogs playing in a small grassy yard that is accessible from the 1st floor. Each floor has its own laundry room that is shared by tenants on the floor. Street parking is very easy in the area with parking either right out front or right along Warrington avenue. We require the first month, last month, and a security deposit before move-in. Tenant pays gas, electric, and internet. And yes, pets are allowed :)\n","num_images":22,"lat":39.94861,"lng":-75.217121,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1Ba', '950ft2', 'available may 1', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'flooring: wood', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-04-02T17:07:45-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-spacious-bright-bdr\/7466208902.html","post_id":7466208902,"result_date":"2022-04-02 16:54","title":"Spacious, bright 2 Bdr overlooking Kahn Park.","description":"Sunny, spacious 2 Bdr.
