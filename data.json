Temp for school year only.\nRental must be located in the Lincoln High School attendance area.\nplease respond via email.\nMy name is Richard and I'm in search of a room for rent or a small mother-in-law studio.\nAbout me:\nI am 29 years old, independent and work full time as a provider for adults with mental disabilities. I also do DoorDash on the side and wildland firefighting when it gets super busy! I love to go on hikes with my girlfriend, cooking, baking, gardening, woodworking, and I also dabble in photography. When I'm not home I'm usually working or going for a walk\/hike when time permits. One of the things I really enjoy is tending to my house plants, it provides me a sense of relaxation and meditation. I also have a feline friend, Rex, who is like a son to me and will be registered soon a therapy animal.\nThe nitty-gritty:\nMy budget is around $700-$850. I'm very on time with rent and utilities. As far as cleanliness goes, I'm almost a neat freak but definitely not over baring about it! I just like my spaces to be nice :) My cat is also very clean because he mostly favors the outdoors. He does have a box but like I stated before I'm very clean so there's rarely ever a mess. I've had roommates in the past that have been over baring about cleanliness but hey, life comes around and sometimes we can't do it at the moment. The areas I'm looking in are Tigard, Beaverton, Multnomah Village, Reighleh Hills, west Portland, etc.\nI am also open to doing work around the house for part of the rent or some maintenance inside the home as well! I can do gardening, lawn care, power washing, painting, small in home fixes, etc.\nIf this seems like it would be a good fit for you please let me know. I would love to chat over the phone and then meet :)\nI've recently moved my on-line book business into an office in the Woodstock neighborhood, and would like to rent a room or apartment close by. Have been renting near 17th and Clinton for 5 years and before that living in the Montgomery dorm at PSU for 9 years.\nBeen selling books on-line for 20 years and earn a comfortable income. Can pay between $400 and $600 for the right place\n2 adults and 3 children seeking a rental in Vancouver WA or surrounding areas, myself and my fiance are both relocating for work from Bellingham Washington and we will be working for the same company. I will be working as a Production Supervisor and She will be an Assistant Manager. WE both have great work history and rental history and I am a Homeowner in process of selling my house.\nNeed something in the range of $1700- $2250 Depending of home size, quality of home, neighborhood and amenities.\nWould be ideal if we can have no fees or waived fees due to having to pay last month where we live now and pay rent in our new place.\nIf we can work something out email me.\nI am a senior, looking for a private bedroom with bathroom in your home. I am very responsible, respectful and clean with a limited income. My hope is to find a place to live as soon as possible. I have been a homeowner most of my life but now that has changed due to unforeseen circumstances. I am able to pay $500 with all utilities included. Another option is to provide childcare and\/or light housekeeping in lieu of rent. Please text me if you have any questions.\nMy name is Noah (28 yrs of age) and I\u2019m staying in my car and as one would know with it being hot out it\u2019d be nice to stay an a more open space. I\u2019m a good casual individual just wanting a comfortable hood place for tonight. I can give you some money but I can\u2019t afford motel\/hotel prices.
