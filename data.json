Center City Philadelphia Apartments Near Rittenhouse Square Be a part of history! ICON mixes the beauty of the past with the modern amenities of today. Included on the\u00c3\u201a\u00c2 National Register of Historic Places this incredible rental building soars to new heights, just like its iconic, ziggurat-topped peak. Looking for a downtown Philadelphia apartment near\u00c3\u201a\u00c2 Rittenhouse Square? You've found it! ICON is the most exciting rental property to ever grace Rittenhouse Square. A quintessential example of the Art Deco exuberance that defined the 1920s and 30s, ICON's design is inspired by Art Deco's geometric shapes and today's streamlined lifestyle. With this historic luxury building, you can be within steps of all the fine dining, high-end retail and cultural offerings that Philadelphia has to offer. The most fashionable edifice of its day, ICON is as rich in history as it is in beauty. Opened in 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression, the building's ground floor tenants included both Cunard's White Star Line and the United States Lines, and the esteemed Pew family maintained a pied-a-terre on the 25th Floor. Today, this history echoes throughout ICON, a building that is a rare architectural experience.

You just hit the jackpot. You happened to stumble upon one of the few houses available that will actually exceed your expectations! I have for rent a GIGANTIC and amazing 3 bedroom\/2.5 bathroom house in an amazing location, just shy of 2,00 square feet. What makes this place so amazing? First go grab yourself a cup of coffee or a beer because it will take an eternity to describe how epic this place is. Let me start by listing a few of the local perks:\nLocation. Location. Location. That's what they say right? The closest cross streets are Coral Street and Dauphin Street. I'm struggling on where to start to describe all the awesome things around here, there are so many places to list. Walking distance to two stops on the El (perfect if you work anywhere downtown). Like to enjoy the night life or a beer here and there? Once again you've just hit the jackpot. A quick walk down to places like Frankford Hall, Johnny Brenda's, Barcade, Bottle Bar East..etc. etc. Those are just a quick walk!\nWant to know what you could literally crawl to? Within crawling distance are amazing spots like Loco Pez, Cedar Point, York Street Tavern, Luke's Bar, Memphis Taproom, Bob's Happy Hour, Philadelphia Brewing Company, Atlantis, annnnd the list goes on! Are you a foodie? Yet again, jackpot. The list could go on forever so I'll save you the time.\nThe Piazza....you can walk there, it takes about 10 minutes. If you aren't familiar with The Piazza and EVERYTHING it has to offer, let me fill you in. This place is a constant stream of entertainment. Concerts, sports, restaurants, bars, food trucks, street fairs, everything under the sun. You can also check out their website, just Google The Piazza.\nParking. One of the biggest problems in the city is trying to find a parking spot. You can drive around for an hour sometimes looking for a spot, and even if you find one you run the risk of not having the right parking pass....such a hassle! Guess what?! No parking passes needed throughout the entire neighborhood, and on top of that the furthest I've had to park away was about a block, with typical parking right outside of the house!\nThe Neighborhood. People in the neighborhood are extremely nice. A good mix of ages and ethnicities, and in general, just amazing people. All of the neighbors look out for each other and they definitely make you feel at home.\nThe House. This place is great! Built in 2012, and recently went through a six month restoration. Full amenities, including a gas range, dual oven, dishwasher, granite counter-tops, backsplash, a giant island, full size stainless steel fridge with filtered water access, a gigantic stainless steel BBQ with natural gas (never have to worry about running out of propane), A\/C and heat obviously, a private back patio, a basement for storage, two closets and a half bath on the first floor, energy efficient front loaded washer and dryer upstairs. Hardwood floors throughout, and modern style loft feel throughout the entire house.\nThe average row-home in Philadelphia is 10-12 feet wide, this place is double that at 23 feet wide. So you don't get that cramped row-home feeling you get in all the other places in Philadelphia. It really is quite the unique and special spot! You have to see it to get the full appreciation. Total square footage is just shy of 2,000 square feet. More pictures will be uploaded this weekend, please contact me via email to set up a time to view and with any questions. I'll have select viewing times on New Years Weekend (12\/30 and 12\/31), and then the Monday and Tuesday (1\/2 and 1\/3).\nNow onto the boring stuff: Rent is $3750 per month plus all utilities excluding water. Two-year minimum rental, a longer duration can be discussed. First and last months rent due at lease signing. This is a no-smoking and no-pet property. Family preferred. Each tenant over the age of 18 will be required to complete a background check prior to signing of lease agreement (link will be provided for completion). If approved to move in, cost for background check will be deducted from first month's rent.\nI am looking for a family or group of professionals with a good employment history, financially stable, and has a good history with previous renting with references. Ideally, a family that places a high importance on being respectful, courteous, clean and laid back. If you are interested, please email me with some information about yourself and we will set up a time to talk. Any questions please ask, thanks for taking the time to read consider my home to rent.","num_images":13.0,"lat":39.982771,"lng":-75.130538,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2.5Ba', '1980ft2', 'available dec 30', 'townhouse', 'w\/d in unit', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-12-27T14:43:16-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/7572288497.html","post_id":7572288497,"result_date":"Tue Dec 27 2022 19:40:02 GMT+0000 ","title":"Comfort, convenience and unmatched amenities. 2 BR\/2 BA, 1088 SqFt","description":"-- Millview Apartments -- show contact info\nMonthly Rent:  $1651 - $2210 Apartment: 2 Bedroom | 2 Bathroom  Square Footage:  1088 sq ft Nestled high on a wooded hillside in picturesque Chester County, Millview Apartment Homes boasts contemporary designs with bright and spacious one and two bedroom floor plans.
