It's really a sweet block\nThe bedroom easily fits a queen or king bed. Right now we have a queen bed, very large dresser, book shelf, and two arm chairs in it. There are two closets in the bedroom, one the size of a typical non-walk-in closet, the other much larger with storage space above and behind where clothes would hang.\nThe living room and kitchen are open into one another as shown in pictures, but large enough for a table and eating area plus a designated living room space with couches and chairs. We also have a \"landing nook\" with some storage set up and room for shoes and coats just inside of the front door.\nBathroom has a tub and great shower pressure, as well as a large frosted window so it also gets lovely natural light.\nThis space is great for a single person with pets or a couple.\nEmail me for more photos, a video walk through, or to stop by and view in person.
