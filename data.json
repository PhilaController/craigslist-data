I'm looking for a cat-free dog friendly home with minimal stairs for me and my old lady pup! I have until middle of October to find something but the sooner the better. I'm getting my ankle reconstructed on Friday July 22nd so I won't be able to view places for a couple weeks and probably realistically won't be able to move until mid August.\nI am seeking an environment with others who value open communication, clean common spaces, no passive aggressive behavior, and take personal growth seriously. I value my home being my safe place. I'm 420 friendly, but not a drinker or into hard drugs and prefer to live with the same. I love to cook, garden, disc golf, road trip, Netflix, go on adventures, take the dog out. I actually like being a responsible adult lol. I am coming out of a toxic living situation with a former partner and need a safe environment for healing.\nI am a self employed massage therapist and herbalist. It would be great to find a place that had space to see clients and do my herb work. Depending on how much space is provided will depict how much I'm willing to spend on rent. An ADU would be ideal or splitting a house with one other. Prefer east side.\nShow me what you have! Please put \"\"Hello beautiful potential new roommate\"\" in three subject line so I know you aren't spam.\nLove and Light, -R\nHey! My name is Zack and I'm currently looking for a place to rent around the Portland area I don't need anything large I'm traveling by myself! I've been a fire performer for 8 years and a chef for 12 years, no criminal record (surprising, right? Lol) I'm 26 years old, I consider myself funny, nice, clean and smart. Love to socialize but I can also keep to myself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nI could pay anything below a thousand a month and a safety deposit right off the bat.\nI'm a Down to earth hippie person just trying to find happiness and good vibes, I don't mind cats or dogs!\nMy phone number will be attached, but you can email me. Please ask questions and I'm hoping I'm the right fit for you!\nI am a 28-year-old single parent of a five-year-old and we are moving from Colorado. We are looking for a room to rent for at least two months while I figure out employment and childcare. I can afford about 800 upfront for the first month. I will be moving up to Oregon around mid- late August\nSingle 47-year-old guy and his medium-sized dog seeking a pet-friendly rental in the greater Vancouver\/Portland metro area \u2014 preferably one with a separate living area or even an ADU or back house, preferably \u2014 but I am flexible.\nI\u2019m currently living in my hometown in Southern California, but I\u2019m hoping to secure a rental back up in the Pacific Northwest as soon as possible.\nI lived for six months last year in Kelso, Washington, and I really liked the area; however, it was a bit too far from the Vancouver\/Portland metro, so I\u2019m looking for a rental a bit closer to the City (at least a bit closer). Also, I was living on a horse farm just north of Kelso, which was nice, but the rental unit itself was very old and in need of repair, so I decided it was best to leave. Electrical and plumbing issues galore over that six months!\nMy goal was to stay in Washington long-term, but I ended up returning to CA after six months (I actually have a Washington driver\u2019s license and car plates).\nCurrently, I write online and drive for Uber\/Lyft the rest of the time. I used to operate my own small petsitting service down in Southern California for several years prior to Covid; however, the pandemic and subsequent lockdown curtailed that for the past few years only to slowly return to normal recently.\nMy goal is to eventually establish myself in the Portland\/Vancouver area and eventually relaunch a pet-care business up there. In the meantime, though, I\u2019m looking to simply secure a small rental for the next 6 months or so.\nI\u2019m hoping to find a pet-friendly rental that has at least a small, fenced-in yard for my dog to use. Really, my dog is my only main concern; she\u2019s young (2 years old) and loves to be outdoors. Unfortunately, though, she doesn\u2019t always mesh well with other dogs, so ideally I need to find a place in which I can separate her from other animals (just to be prudent).\nPersonally, I don\u2019t drink or smoke, don\u2019t do drugs, and pretty much lead a very quiet, conservative lifestyle. No criminal background whatsoever. I\u2019m respectful and pretty much just keep to myself.\nI\u2019m an introvert looking for a room to rent. I\u2019m a friendly person, but NOT looking for a \u2018community\u2019 home or to share groceries with my roommate. I\u2019m just a person that would love to live alone but cannot afford to live alone. Anyone else out there just trying to live there life and doesn\u2019t feel a need to have all the same hobbies and interests and favorite movies with there roommate, let me know.\n","num_images":3,"lat":40.0369,"lng":-75.0664,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2.5Ba', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-07-16T14:40:24-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-bedroom-bath-townhome\/7509601457.html","post_id":7509601457,"result_date":"2022-07-16 14:41","title":"4 bedroom, 2 \u00bd bath townhome","description":"Luxury living in society hill community awaits in this 4 bedroom, 2 \u00bd bath townhome with all the amenities.
