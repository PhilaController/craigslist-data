The third floor has the master suite: bedroom, walk in closet, full bathroom, linen closet, and 3rd floor north facing private balcony. The unfinished basement houses large, top loading, washer and drier. There is ample storage space in the basement, which has also been previously utilized as an exercise room.

This home is a short walk from Whole Foods (2 Blocks, 3 minute walk), ACME (3 blocks, 5 minute walk) and the Italian Market (5 blocks, 6 minute walk).\nAlso conveniently accessible are delicious and highly regarded restaurants and bars, which are too many to list (inquire for suggestions regardless of intention to rent!), as well as coffees shops. The house is a 10 minute walk to the Broad Street Subway (BSL) and Path to NJ. This home rests between two wonderful parks, Palumbo Recreation Center to the west, and Cianfrani Park to the east. Center City East and West are also readily accessible on foot, and University City\/ West Philadelphia are easily accessed by bus (40), bike or car.

Located in the heart of Northern Liberties is this brick front, 4-bedroom, 3 full bathroom home that has been professionally renovated from top to bottom, inside and out, with no expense spared.  The approach to your home is outlined by a new driveway, walkway, and planter bed. The new roof, iron rails and black exterior windows provide a crisp contrast to the classic brick fa\u00e7ade. As you step inside you are immersed in natural daylight and an open concept plan that leads your eyes straight through the kitchen to the first exterior patio space! This main level features new windows, recessed lighting, and hardwood floors throughout. The kitchen doesn\u2019t miss a beat providing contemporary white shaker cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, subway tile backsplash and gorgeous quartz countertops. An abundance of cabinetry and center island provide endless storage possibilities. There is a new deck right off the kitchen with enough space to entertain and grill or just take in the mornings with a fresh cup of coffee! As you head upstairs you will notice the consistent flow of the hardwoods, a hall bath featuring rippled, white subway tile and black fixtures. There are two generous sized bedrooms with recessed lighting on this floor and then the primary suite boasting two closets, recessed lighting, and a spa-like ensuite with walk in shower completed with a gray marble like tile on floors and walls with a natural stone shower base and black fixtures.
