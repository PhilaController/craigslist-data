Your next step is to schedule an appointment to tour with Michelle or Gabby on our website at rittenhouseclaridge.com. We offer in-person tours and live virtual tours in Zoom. You gain a lot of information on the tour, including pricing and availability.\nRental rate posted is for the 22 month lease term. Price depends upon lease term.\nFor an unfurnished home, 2 to 22 month lease terms are available!\nRental rates, availability, and apartment home features are subject to change without notice.\nWe can furnish a home for you over two weeks following rental application approval and after the home is made ready. Please note that there is a three-month lease term minimum for a furnished home. You would pay a furnished rent instead of an unfurnished rent. We can calculate this furnished rent for you based upon your choices of home furnishings.\nRittenhouse Claridge\nWelcome home!","num_images":24.0,"lat":39.949721,"lng":-75.170581,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '575ft2', 'available aug 29', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'no smoking', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-05-23T13:14:42-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-700ft2-very-private-unit\/7624425273.html","post_id":7624425273,"title":"700FT2 VERY PRIVATE UNIT +$1200 1BR\/1BA+AVAILABLE 6-21-23 NEW APT","description":"1519 N 20th St, $1200 1br\/1ba, 700ft2 very private unit in well maintained and safe Honu Alahele subdivision, dedicated off-street parking, large entry room\/dining area, kitchen with 7 ft3 refrigerator, microwave, no stove\/oven, cherry wood cabinets, air-conditioners and ceiling fans in entry room and bedroom, washer (no dryer), 1 year lease, includes water, refuse and $100 allowance for electricity; no pets, no smoking, not HUD approved.
