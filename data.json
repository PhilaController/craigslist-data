It also has one of the nicest layouts at the Lenox. It is a SE corner unit on a high floor with lots of windows, including 3 bay windows, great light and fantastic views. This unit is the largest one-bedroom in the building and has the same square footage as most two bedrooms units. The vestibule, large rooms and high ceilings give the home a grand look and feel. One side of the vestibule leads to a spacious living room with built in bookcases and two bay windows, a formal dining room and a beautiful kitchen. The fully renovated kitchen includes custom cabinets, stainless steel appliances, ceramic tile flooring and granite countertops. The other side of the vestibule has a huge bedroom that has a den, built in bookcases, walk-in-closet and a bay window. The master bedroom has a closet organizing system. The home has a split unit air conditioning system. The Lenox was designed by famed New York architects Clinton and Russell. It was built in 1920 and renovated into condos in 2004-5. The units have large scale rooms, high ceilings, lots of windows and most units have many of their original architectural elements. It is a doorman building and is centrally located at the southern end of Mid-town Village in Washington Square West. It is two blocks from the great shops, restaurants, theatres, Kimmel Center and night life of Midtown Village, Walnut Street and the Avenue of the Arts. It is also just a few blocks from Thomas Jefferson and Pennsylvania Hospitals. There are many gym, parking and public transportation options nearby. The Lenox has a large central laundry room, but the association now allows owners to install individual units within owner condos, with some restrictions and installation requirements.","num_images":20.0,"lat":39.94724,"lng":-75.162513,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '1352ft2', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-02-02T03:38:10-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-56th-st-west-philadelphia\/7585079384.html","post_id":7585079384,"title":"56th st west Philadelphia house for rent","description":"Looking for RENT!!!
