I am looking to rent the upcoming school year in a nice attic space, side space or basement space that is good for quiet study. I keep to myself, but can be very available and kind in social settings. I have a car but would like my commute to cocc to be easy. My budget is 500-700 for rent. I do have my bed and sewing machine table that I would need to accommodate. I am unfortunately not looking for shared housing with a bunch of people as I am looking for a quiet environment to study. A family home with a rentable private space would be perfect. (Needs to respect lgbt) Thank you!\nHello,\nI am seekinga roomate for Nov 1st to rent a house with. I am a single adult in my mid thirties trying to live in Bend at a reasonable rate somewhere that is more than 500 square feet. I am very active and not home often but when I am home I like having more than 500 square feet to live in. I get along with everyone but I don't drink alot or smoke weed. I really just work out and play guitar and work. I'm also LGBT so if your homophobic than we are not a good fit. I look forward to hearing from anyone interested who fits the description!\nWe are two 21 year-old seeking a third roommate to join our housing search. We are hoping to find an affordable place in Bend or Redmond, and move in by October 1st.\nI am from Bend, and currently going to school full-time. I enjoy art, yoga, and spending time outdoors. My friend (the other roommate) is from Idaho, and she works full-time in Bend. She enjoys hiking, paddle boarding, reading and taking care of her (many) plants. We both live in Redmond now, but because of our plans for school\/work, would prefer to find a place in Bend to avoid the commute.\nBoth of us are non-smokers (no cigarettes or weed) and we would consider a cat, but prefer to not have pets. Our goal is to have a clean and relaxing home-base for everyone. So we should all feel welcome to have friends over, but avoid becoming a party house or having excessive overnight guests.\nOur budget is 700-800 (lower if possible) and we will likely be signing a 6-12 month lease. We are both responsible\/financially stable, and looking for another reliable person.\nHi there! I am transferring back to Bend (I\u2019ve only been away two years and are VERY happy to be coming back) through my work (The American Red Cross) and are in need of a room or someone to split a place with around mid November. I\u2019ve been with the Red Cross for 14yrs, have a credit score over 800, and will qualify for up to 1200\/mo on an application but really don\u2019t want to spend more than 900\/mo for rent (including utilities).\nI just thought I\u2019d put myself out there in CL land to see if I could start networking since most if not all the rooms-for-rent ads are looking to fill in September right now. I start work in Bend early October and have secured a sublet\/temp through November 15th which is when I\u2019ll need a permanent living situation.\nAbout me: I have , , non-smoker, occasional drinker, definitely no drugs, get up and go to bed early, single, don\u2019t go \u201cout\u201d at night and love to recreate outside. I come with a mountain bike, a paddle board, camp and backpack gear, and of course, my Subaru, Patagonia bag and Kuhl puffy coat;) I guess I\u2019m technically middle aged, but perhaps still in denial lol. Oh! I also house\/dog sit on the side therefore occasionally won\u2019t even be home for periods of time. I\u2019m very considerate, respectful and responsible and for the most part keep to myself. I like to garden, hike, bike, take photos, read, and eat good food! I am cordial and friendly but aren\u2019t expecting to be best friends, just wanting to share a space in order to live in an affordable, decent way.\nSome expectations in a roommate: Just common sense stuff like, please don\u2019t bang pots and pans together while I\u2019m trying to sleep, please don\u2019t bring random strangers over to \u201cparty\u201d or stay the night, please clean up the kitchen after you make a meal, please take turns deep cleaning common areas, please don\u2019t be a drug addict or alcoholic and steal stuff. I don\u2019t mind having occasional get togethers as I may have a friend or two over once in a while for dinner or something, but I don\u2019t want to live in a \u201cparty\u201d or dirty house. I work a lot and will need and want a peaceful, positive environment to rest and rejuvenate.\nHi, my name is Yolanda, and I\u2019m in need of a room to rent in any of the cities I have listed, I am currently living in Yakima, and trying to leave a bad toxic living situation up here and be back down living near all my family in Auburn. I can pay 500, maybe up to 550, and once I\u2019m able to get situated and find a job I can pay more.\nI\u2019m 26, been told I\u2019m very easy going, kind, with a \u201cmomma bear\u201d nature. I can be very introverted and shy at first, but once I\u2019m comfortable I open up to being my silly, weird, quirky true self. I\u2019m a gamer for life type, and a homebody. I\u2019m waaaaay past my party days, so you don\u2019t have to worry about me bringing random people over and partying.\nI can slip up and be a bit loud from raging\/excitement with video games, but it\u2019s not constant. I am Demi-Pansexual, so a household that is LGTBTQ+ friendly would be best.\nIf you think I\u2019d be a good fit for your room, email me with a bit about you, the room, and any other questions you may have about me. Thankies for taking the time to read this. \u2728\n","num_images":4.0,"lat":40.040942,"lng":-75.065289,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2Ba', '19149ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-08-31T12:39:31-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/woodlyn-spacious-bedroom-in-chester\/7528235306.html","post_id":7528235306,"result_date":"2022-08-31 12:42","title":"Spacious 1 Bedroom in Chester","description":"Schedule a Tour!\nBook an appointment online at 2tour.site\/3IL\/N499\n\nGreen Forest offers amazing amenities and large homes.
