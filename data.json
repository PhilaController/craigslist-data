The foyer entry features porcelain tile, a coat closet, and provides two entrances to the main level living space, all with NEW hardwood flooring, baseboard and trim- no expense was spared! The kitchen is the true WOW of the home, boasting \"shaker\" style white cabinets with crown molding and custom designed shelving and wine rack, quartz countertops, new appliances, beautiful ceramic tile backsplash behind the range, with range hood, and a spacious two tiered island with seating (in a tasteful blue accent color) and a large stainless steel undermount sink, as well as a nearby pantry closet- between the abundance of cabinets and pantry, you will never have a shortage of storage for all of your kitchen items. Two skylights compliment this space, as well! There is a back door off of the kitchen that leads to a new patio and rear level yard. Back inside, there are two rooms, open to each side of the kitchen, that you can purpose as you wish! The option for a breakfast room\/formal dining, living room, are all there for you, as well as an additional coat closet near the side entry to the home from an attached garage that was recently added.

With this historic luxury building, you can be within steps of all the fine dining, high-end retail and cultural offerings that Philadelphia has to offer.

Today, this history echoes throughout ICON, a building that is a rare architectural experience. The lobby is so stunning it will make you stop in your tracks, with its Art Deco-styled elevators, glazed black brick and grey porcelain flooring and a cast-bronze portal.
