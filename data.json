Located in one of the hottest neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Brewerytown. This is new construction at it's finest. As you enter your new home your are greeted by the Hardwood Avalanche Natural Oak floors that flow throughout your new home on the main and upper levels. Your lovely new home is elegantly staged and you already feel like there's no place like your new home. You step into the living room and really like all of the natural sunlight coming in through the windows. Next you enter into the dining room area and start to enjoy the open floor plan that floats from the living room through the dining room area and into the kitchen with Thassos White Quartz countertop and island. Standing in your new kitchen just makes your jaw drop and mouth water as you imagine all of the meals you will prepare and enjoy in your new home. Your kitchen is complimented with shaker cabinets with slow closing drawers and stainless steel appliances that consist of refrigerator, stove, microwave, and dishwasher. You peak into the back yard and love the amount of outdoor space you have to entertain guests. You step back inside and head to the lower level which is fully finished with a den area that can be used as an exercise room, theater room, home office or whatever your imagination leads you to. The fully finished basement features a full bathroom with vanity, toilet, and a custom tiled stand up shower. You step into the fourth bedroom that can be used by guests who stay over or extend it into an in-law suite. So far you are filled with excitement and can't wait to head upstairs to check out the rest of your new home. Once at the top of the stairs of the second level, you open the hallway double doors to find a front load washer and dryer that makes it so convenient for laundry. You step into the bedroom and like how nicely sized it is with ample closet space and additional storage space on top of the closet for when switching your wardrobe from season to season. You head towards the next bedroom and stop to check out the second bathroom that features vanity, toilet, and tub\/shower with custom tiled walls surrounding the tub. Now you step into the next bedroom and really like how big it is and notice that it also has a large closet with additional storage space on top of it. You head to the third level which is the master suite with walk-in closet and the master bathroom. As soon as you enter you are amazed on how big the master bedroom is and how beautifully it is staged. You walk around to take it all in from each angle and as you head into the walk-in closet you stop and can picture yourself waking up every morning to this beauty. Your master bathroom features vanity, toilet, and a massive stand up shower. You open the tempered shower glass door and it's like love at first sight. You look up and notice that the shower comes with two rain fall shower heads and this just completes your new home with the cherry on top. Now you head up to the rooftop and the views are spectacular. You are really thrilled to have toured your new home and can't wait to unpack. Your gorgeous home is located right next to 30th and Jefferson Street Park with a basketball court, baseball field, and playground. It is within walking distance to popular coffee shops, Cafe de Lave, iMunch, 29 Oxford Restaurant, Otto's Taproom, Spot Gourmet Burgers, Fit Academy, and easy access to the Art Museum, Center City, 76, and so much more.
