Additionally, there is a coat closet near the entrance and a convenient half-bath off the living space. The grand kitchen has all stainless steel appliances, metallic tile backsplash, granite countertops and plenty of cabinet space thanks to the built-in shelving along the side wall. Did we mention this also has a breakfast bar area? Heading up the gorgeous custom staircase you'll find two large bedrooms on the second floor, that each have their own private full bath with natural light, modern fixtures, tiled showers and floors. The industrial theme continues upstairs with the painted brick walls, exposed ductwork, pipe railings and wall detail. There is a laundry\/office nook in the hall between the two bedrooms, and walk-through wardrobe closets on the way to the front bedroom. The location is ideal as well. Situated only a block of Frankford Ave., around the corner from Palmer Park, and close to public transportation and all the dining and entertainment you will need! Do not wait! This one-of-a-kind rental will not last long.
