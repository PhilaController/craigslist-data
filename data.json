There is also a \"powder room\" (sink, toilet, but no shower) in the living room, for guests.  Two of the bedrooms have an ensuite bathroom.  The master bedroom's bathroom has a massive 5 foot vanity sink and walk in shower.  The master bedroom also has 2 closets (one is a walk in closet).  The \"loft\" is larger than the master bedroom; taking up the entire 4th floor.  The third bedroom is smaller; I normally would rent it out for $600 to $700 but, recently, converted it to an office while working remotely during covid.\nI love to cook and haven't found a better kitchen.  The stove and range use natural gas.  The stove, range, microwave, and fridge are close enough to each other that it's a breeze to grab ingredients\/equipment and move around.  Close proximity usually means less counterspace, however there is a 42inch by 38inch island that more than makes up for it.  I usually sprawl the cook book, cutting boards, and ingredients out across the island as needed.  The sink is a single, 30 inch wide, stainless steel bowl with a garbage disposal unit.  The garbage disposal is a badger model 5-84.  The sink features a Moen brand single handle pullout kitchen faucet (model 7545).  The faucet pulls out 36 inches (3 feet) and has 3 water pressure modes and a \"pause\" feature.  The pause feature is nice if you are filling up something like a spaghetti pots and you don't want to put the pot in a dirty sink.  You can leave the pot on the counter, turn on the water then \"pause\" the flow until the faucet is over the pot.  Small things are sometimes the best part.  If you'd like to picture the appliances, the dishwaser is a whirlpool WDF520PADM5, the stove\/gas range is a GE model JGB660SEJ1SS, and the microwave is a GE model JNM3163RJ1SS.\nThe house uses natural gas.  The water heater, hvac unit, and stove\/range use it.  I decided not to have the washer and dryer hooked up to natural gas because they wiggle around when in use.  I'd rather not deal with gas leaks.\nThere is a patio that gets sunlight in the morning.  The two sliding glass doors light up the living room and kitchen and make for a very nice morning.\nIn terms of parking, the garage has space for two cars and the extended driveway can fit another.  Depending on the time of year, I'd use the garage space for various hobbies and have friends\/family use the street parking.  The street parking is ample and tickets are only issued on Thursday mornings (when the street sweeper drives through).\nI just had new carpet installed on April 7th and have a painter coming the week of the 25th.\nThe trash and recycling is on Monday; they generally come around 8am.  There are two 96 gallon containers: one for recycling and one for trash.  Bulk item collection is the first Wednesday of each month.  One large household item allowed, excluding hazardous waste, covered electronics, construction debris, or metal appliances.  Additional collection can be arranged at a fee.\nI know my direct neighbors personally, if there are noise issues I can call and talk to them.  The community is young adults and families.  I'd prefer to rent to someone who would fit in with the neighbors.\n","num_images":24.0,"lat":39.96046,"lng":-75.597364,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 3.5Ba', '1984ft2', 'available may 1', '\\nthursday 2022-04-21\\n', '\\nfriday 2022-04-22\\n', '\\nsunday 2022-04-24\\n', 'air conditioning', 'flooring: carpet', 'furnished', 'townhouse', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: yearly']","posted_date":"2022-04-17T13:41:26-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-spacious-bedroom-with\/7472453453.html","post_id":7472453453,"result_date":"2022-04-17 14:49","title":"Spacious 1 Bedroom with Parking and Laundry in West Mount Airy","description":"Lovely1 Bedroom apartment with PARKING in the heart of West Mount Airy, steps away from neighborhood favorites such as Weavers Way Co-Op, Big Blue Marble Bookstore and High Point Cafe.
