Section 8- 4 bedroom vouchers ONLY, no JP Court landlord\/tenant complaints, and no evictions!  A spacious 1250 Sq ft 4-bedroom townhouse for lease in New Castle, DE, within the development of Oakmont.\nDescription\nThe house has four bedrooms (1 bedroom on the lower-level & 3 bedrooms on the top level), two full baths, and spacious living & dining rooms.  The kitchen is small; however, it has lots of closet\/storage space.  You will find hardwood flooring on the main and upper bedroom levels, but vinyl flooring is on the lower level. There is a large family room, laundry room with a washer & dryer, small patio, fenced-in yard, and one-car driveway.\nTenant expenses\nYou should know I am advertising the property for $1,299 per month; however, the lease agreement is for $1,499 per month, which means you will be entitled to a $200.00 discount when the rent is paid on or before the 1st of each month by 4 p.m beginning with your second rental month.  Any payments made after 4 p.m. on the 1st are considered late. What that means is any payment made after 4 p.m. on the 1st or the 2nd, 3rd, or the 4th, you will lose the $200.00 discount, and you must pay the full rental payment of $1,499.00.\nAdditionally, the tenant is responsible for all utilities, including electricity & gas, water, landscaping, snow, and trash removal.\nIncome, credit history, and reference letter requirements\nThe income requirement is\n$4200+ per month for 1 to 2 people\n$4700+ per month for three people\n$5200+ per month for four people\n$5700+ per month for five people. It goes up by $500 for each additional person.\nBackground and credit inquiries are required; however, you do not have to have a perfect background and credit history because everyone makes mistakes from time to time.  However, I do require you have a great rental payment record with no landlord\/tenant payment disputes filed with JPCourt. If you are unaware of a past JP Court complaint, check out their website to see if any complaints were filed against you.\nApplicants will need a reference letter from their landlord, but that won\u2019t count if your landlord is a family member. You will need a letter of recommendation from your last landlord and a character reference from a colleague. I will need a contact telephone number and address for your reference.\u00a0If approved for a one-year lease you will need to pay your 1st months rent and security deposit totalling $2,998.00 when you sign the lease.\nIf you don't meet the income requirements and have a credit score below 650, an exception can be made case-by-case.  In that situation, I can only offer a month-to-month lease. With a month-to-month lease, you must pay one month in security, 1st month\u2019s rent, and the last month\u2019s rent totals $4,497.00.\n","num_images":24,"lat":39.7117,"lng":-75.5525,"attrs":"['4BR \/ 2Ba', '1250ft2', 'air conditioning', 'townhouse', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-12-04T09:57:06-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/7564508760.html","post_id":7564508760,"result_date":"Sun Dec 04 2022 15:32:47 GMT+0000 ","title":"Specious 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment Available Now,","description":"Specious 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment in Philadelphia.
