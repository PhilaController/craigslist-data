I am Looking for two friendly roommates to fill 2 spacious bedrooms in a modern row home in Fishtown (LGBTQIA+ & BIPOC friendly). I\u2019m hoping to find working professional\/graduate level students or higher who are interested in sharing a spacious, well-cared for and welcoming home, and would be open to hosting the occasional rooftop gathering.  All gender identities welcome!  Roommates must be fully COVID vaccinated.\nAbout the Area:\n1438 Germantown Ave is a modern row home that is less than a 15-minute walk from the Girard Station El Station in Fishtown. The house features a large rooftop deck with beautiful views of the Philadelphia skyline and is a short commute (20-minute walk) to Temple\u2019s main campus. Additionally, the home\u2019s close proximity to city bus stops and The El makes it easy to access Center City. Fishtown is a young and vibrant area that is constantly evolving. There are plenty of excellent restaurants and bars that make it an ideal for people looking to explore a different side of Philly.\nAbout the House:\nThere are two large bedrooms available for rent starting June 1st (move-in date potentially flexible depending on circumstances). One room is slightly larger and has three windows ($1,050), while the second room has two windows ($1,000). Both include large closets, plenty of natural light and are on opposite sides of the house (extra privacy). There is also an extra guest bedroom in the basement. Note: My current roommate is looking to sell extra pieces of furniture before he moves out (drawers, bed, closet, bed frame etc.).\nAbout Me:\nI am a 28-year-old social worker originally from the Philly-area looking for two roommates who are excited to share this great house.  I work with children and families and am pursuing my full licensure to eventually run my own private practice but currently I work at a partial program. After work, I enjoy unwinding with a book, dabbling on the guitar, going to the gym, and making use of my instapot (unless their is a good happy hour at the corner brewery). Over the weekends I like to watch whatever game is on with some friends, play games and enjoy the rooftop on nice days as well as advantage of the local bar and restaurant scene (feel free to come with!). I hope any new roommates would enjoy spending some time together and will make good use of the space, while also taking care of it.\nOther features include:\n- In-unit washer & dryer\n- Large guest room with a private bathroom on the ground floor\n- Private rooftop deck with a grill, furniture and view of the skyline\n- Central A\/C and gas heat\n- Spacious modern kitchen with a gas stove and dishwasher\n- Large common areas with plenty of natural light\n- Access to a driveway (potential off-street parking option)\n- 5-15 minute walk to breweries, restaurants, gyms, coffee shops (ReAnimator Coffee\/ La Colombe), Acme, urgent care facilities and more!\n- Under a mile away from Planet Fitness\n- Unfortunately, no pets are allowed by the landlord :(\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the house\/myself, please feel free to DM me and we can set up a time to chat.
