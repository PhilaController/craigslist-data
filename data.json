We are moving locally but uncertain if we will return to our classic Chestnut Hill twin, so are looking for tenants. We have spent several years fixing this gem up, with a brand new kitchen, new patio, new windows and a new heating and air conditioning system, along with other tasteful improvements.\nThe first floor open-plan living and dining room boasts tall ceilings and copious amounts of daylight. Our extremely functional and efficient kitchen is an equally pleasing space, also with plenty of natural light, and there is a tastefully designed pantry\/laundry room off the back of the kitchen. A powder room completes the first floor living space, while there is a large storage area before walking out to the back garden.\nThere are three bedrooms on the second floor, including a master bedroom with plenty of storage and a fireplace. Two moderate sized bedrooms are perfect for home offices or kids bedrooms. A full bathroom is located on this floor.\nThe fourth bedroom is on the third floor and has commanding views and tons of daylight. There is an adjacent 3\/4 bath, and down the hall is a walk-in closet (that we use as a small office space).\nOutdoors, there is a full street-side porch that faces southwest, and a small porch on the side of the house that faces southeast and overlooks a very large flagstone patio. New plantings abound and fencing frame the outdoor space which is perfect for entertaining or for kids play.\nOther details:\n- Basement is partially finished and offers plenty of storage.\n- New heating and air conditioning units are among the most efficient available, so heating and cooling bills are very manageable.\n- Offstreet parking for two cars.\n- Alarm\/Fire system available for hookup.\n- Utilities to be paid by tenant.\nOur home is best described as a sunny and light-filled, with a deep and wide (for its location) garden and patio area. Because of our location we also get unusually long views so you do not feel hemmed in by neighbors. We are a block from the Chestnut Hill West Station and a block from Germantown Avenue, so it is hard to get more convenient if you, like us, enjoy not getting in the car to do everything.\nWe are looking for tenants who appreciate living in an old home and will take care of it. We prefer no pets but would consider on a case-by-case basis a cat or small dog. We seek a one year lease.\nOur move-out date is a bit uncertain so we are exploring the level of interest. We anticipate being out by June 30 or possibly into July. We will update the listing with current photos in the coming days, but the included teaser photos are from when we purchased the home some years ago (decor and setup is very different now).\nIf you are interested, please tell us a little bit about yourself so that we can understand if this might be a good fit.\n","num_images":3,"lat":40.074661,"lng":-75.207752,"attrs":"['4BR \/ 2.5Ba', '2500ft2', 'available jul 1', 'air conditioning', 'flooring: wood', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: yearly']","posted_date":"2022-03-17T08:51:34-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-penthouse-unit-2nd-floor\/7459483660.html","post_id":7459483660,"result_date":"2022-03-17 14:14","title":"Penthouse Unit (w\/ 2nd floor loft) w\/ 20ft Ceilings and Exposed Brick","description":"Listing Description:\nGorgeous 1 bedroom unit ( available furnished or unfurnished) which with bonus loft that has been used before as 2nd bedroom or home office in old mill building with hardwood floors, granite counters.
