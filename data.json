We will be signing the lease over to you & will be able to renew the lease after this current lease is over which is 6\/30\/23, so then your actual lease will start after that. I was advised instead of paying the property manager the security deposit & last months rent u would be paying me once u get approved which is $2k total. They will keep what I initially paid for the deposit\/last months for your stay of the lease you will get that back whenever you decide to move out.  I am moving back home late dec to help care for my father who is ill recently. This is a really good place for the price and how much space you get. Good for 1 or 2 people.
