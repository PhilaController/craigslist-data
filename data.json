As you approach the front walkway and freshly painted front door you will notice perennial plantings in the garden beds just beginning to blossom. The recently remodeled enclosed front porch and gambrel roof are just some of the defining architectural features of this classic turn-of-the-century home that instantly present you with charm and good craftsmanship. The Wissahickon schist construction details along the first floor are the perfect accents to the home's exterior. Moving inside, you will notice the versatile and light-filled enclosed porch that provides the perfect \"landing area\" for yourself and your guests before entering the formal living room. The entire home features refinished original hardwood floors with inlaid borders throughout the first floor. Beyond the living room, the open and modern kitchen\/dining area offers flexibility and functionality while blending the two spaces seamlessly. A large bay window allows sunlight to pour into the dining area, with an unobstructed view outdoors. A first floor powder room, adjacent to the kitchen, was added by the current owners as another thoughtful update, as well as first floor laundry to the rear. Moving upstairs, the full bathroom and linen closet are conveniently located at the end of the hall, and the home's original layout of three well-sized bedrooms continues down the hall, with the main bedroom in the front of the house. Back outside, the driveway leads to the detached garage (with new roof), which allows storage possibilities for bikes, tools, outdoor equipment or even a car! The fully-fenced rear yard is an excellent play space while the back deck allows you to relax while grilling and chilling. Steps from the front door of this home, you will find yourself in a walkable and friendly neighborhood with access to public transit, shopping at major retailers as well as the small businesses of Roxborough","num_images":6.0,"lat":40.0402,"lng":-75.2231,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2Ba', '1682ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'flooring: tile', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'attached garage', 'rent period: yearly']","posted_date":"2022-03-27T17:45:14-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-stunning-bedroom-bathrooms\/7463708710.html","post_id":7463708710,"result_date":"2022-03-27 17:02","title":"stunning 3 bedroom 2 Bathrooms in Philadelphia","description":"Built to fit your lifestyle, The Ledger is the effortless blend of home and community located in the heart of Center City.
