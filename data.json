See the pictures for some recent examples just sold. You always get clean title and great value of theses properties located all over the state of OH in over 40 counties.\nEveryday I work with banks\/hedge funds that must liquidate residential real estate at many times 50% OR LESS (including all closing costs) on the comparable recognized dollar. So buy direct and save lot of money and time!\nMost of these out of state institutions (banks and hedge funds) simply don't want these properties because its not their core business. That's where the opportunity is for you. They just need them GONE quickly.\nI am NOT a realtor or wholesaler but instead a property liquidator. Most buyers of these discount properties resale the properties after their desired markup after a clean-out and various cosmetics improvements. About 30% of theses properties are still occupied and you have to do literally nothing except to re-lease them to the occupant and re-market them.\nI have several out of state buyers that just hire a clean-out\/cosmetic crew (I can recommend some for you) and spend about $1K-$2K to clean-out\/freshen -up and re-market them. Many of my buyers have literally never even (or ever will) set foot in the state of OH and they still make nice profits. Many of these properties are from elderly owners who past away.\nI will be glad to help you connect with various support services that will help you maximize your results . We also have lenders and realtors that will help you if need be to help resale your assets to qualified buyers after you purchase the properties of your choice.\nSimple example: A property that has documented comp value at $80K. You purchase it for just $39.9K (including all closing costs). Or maybe a $100K value home for just $49.9K total costs or LESS. All these assets have meat on the bone (equity) and clean title\nNO financing \/land contracts\/ all cash deals only. All funds professionally handled and closed at local title company. You must register with the fully accredited escrow attorney (no cost) prior to viewing and selecting from ongoing asset list. Properties scattered all over 40+ counties in OH...No Wholesalers please! 100% cash buyers ONLY please\nHOW IT WORKS\n-register as a buyer (No Cost) just sign a brief NDA (privacy agreement)\n-scan the asset list that includes comps\/pictures\/property notes in an easy to read spreadsheet format\n-select (cherry pick) the properties you want most\n-deposit funds in secured escrow account with the escrow attorney ..your clean title deed arrives in about 3 weeks\n-you make money\/equity and select more properties and repeat call or text  show contact info\nanytime\n","num_images":5.0,"lat":40.013,"lng":-75.132,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 1.5Ba', '990ft2', 'available now', '\\nmonday 2022-12-05\\n', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d hookups', 'detached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-12-05T01:58:01-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/7564737702.html","post_id":7564737702,"result_date":"Mon Dec 05 2022 03:02:50 GMT+0000 ","title":"whole floor apartment  2 Bed 1 bath in art museum area","description":"Location!
