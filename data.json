Two roommates are looking for someone to fill a bedroom in our East Kensington apartment. We\u2019ve lived here just about a year, and it\u2019s been great.

The open bedroom is on the first floor and has a cute balcony. Your bathroom is right outside the bedroom. Rent is $1000 a month + utilities so altogether it\u2019s ~$1000. Move in would be July 1, but we can try and work with you if you\u2019re looking to make an earlier move.\nAbout us: We are two young professionals in our twenties!
