Allen St #1. A brief overview of the home would be that this is a 3 story 3 bed 3.5 bath home with finished basement, private parking, and a roof deck \u2013 but this home offers so much more. Opening the doors to what could be your future home you will be amazed at the ceiling height. To your right you have a large coat closet, and private garage access and to your left you have your first bedroom which would be perfect for a home office since it brings in a ton of natural light. The garage has plenty of storage and a plug for your electric car! The basement is finished and is currently being used as a gym. Since the home is only 5 years old all the systems are in great working order and have been regularly maintained. Going up to your main living area on the 2nd floor you have a large living room with tons of Pella windows bringing in a ton of natural light which is perfect for plants, beautiful dark hardwood floors, modern warm gold lighting with an adjustable dimmer and ultra-high ceilings. The kitchen offers all white quartz countertops with island seating, a very large white farm sink with touchless faucet, under cabinet lighting, stainless steel GE appliances, upgraded marble backsplash and last but not least white shaker cabinets with gold accents. This floor also offers a balcony connected to the kitchen, which is perfect for your morning coffee. On to the 3rd floor where you have a large bedroom with lots of closet space. Did I mention you have a view of the city from here? Now let\u2019s talk about this primary bed with a private bath. The bathroom has dual sinks AND dual shower heads! The walk-in closet is a game changer, the seller\u2019s upgraded this when the home was built. Also, on this floor you have your washer and dryer along with a hall bathroom with a deep tub. Last but certainly not least we head up to the roof deck. You have an amazing view of the city from this home, it is perfect for entertaining since there is a wet bar right there when you need it. Also, this home comes with a green roof which is beautiful to look at but also improves the longevity of the roof. Some other quick things to mention about this home is that it is in a gated community, you have a front door with keyless entry, wired Vivint home security with doorbell remote access to open and close garage door on your phone. There are 5 years left on the tax abatement as well. If you buy this home, you will be so close to so many fantastic restaurants and live music venues such as Frankford Hall, The Filmore, Johnny Brenda\u2019s, LMNO and so many more. You have easy access to 95 and 676 to downtown, also you are a quick walk to the Septa train station.","num_images":4,"lat":39.9788,"lng":-75.1262,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 3.5Ba', '1872ft2', 'available jul 1', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-06-02T10:40:53-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-bedroom-apartment-temple\/7491310367.html","post_id":7491310367,"result_date":"2022-06-02 10:44","title":"3 Bedroom Apartment - TEMPLE UNIVERSITY","description":"UNIT #3B\nDUPLEX\nTHREE BEDROOM\nTHREE BATH\nBRAND NEW APPLIANCES\nCENTRAL AIR\nWOOD FLOORING\nLARGE BEDROOMS\nCERAMIC IN KITCHEN AND BATHROOM\nBRAND NEW CONSTRUCTION\nLUXURY APARTMENT\nWASHER AND DRYER IN UNIT\nTEMPLE UNIVERSITY\nLOCATION: 2153 N. 19TH STREET 19121","num_images":7,"lat":39.9811,"lng":-75.174,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 3Ba', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-06-02T10:23:31-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-2609-lippincott-st\/7491317796.html","post_id":7491317796,"result_date":"2022-06-02 10:43","title":"2609 Lippincott St","description":"4 Bedroom , 1 Bath Home in Kensington with rear yard.

I have loved living here and am excited to pass it along to someone who will appreciate it as much as I have. Here are the specs:\n- One bedroom\n- available for a July 1, July 15, or August 1 move-in\n- $1100 per month + gas for cooking and heat + electric\n- easy and abundant street parking *without a permit*\n- pet friendly (I believe I pay a monthly pet fee for my cat and dog so rent may actually be slightly cheaper if you have no pets-- would need to be discussed with the landlord directly)\n- has a tub! Maybe you think it's silly to include this but tubs are for some reason rare in one bedrooms here in West Philly so it's really a find\n- shared yard & large front porch\n- hardwood floors throughout\n- great natural light with two large west facing windows that look out onto the backyard\n- unit is second floor, rear, so it's quiet as it's removed up off of the street\n- easy transit access to both the 34 and 13 trollies, as well as several buses\n- my neighbors are really amazing-- both in the building and in the adjacent ones. It's really a sweet block\nThe bedroom easily fits a queen or king bed. Right now we have a queen bed, very large dresser, book shelf, and two arm chairs in it. There are two closets in the bedroom, one the size of a typical non-walk-in closet, the other much larger with storage space above and behind where clothes would hang.\nThe living room and kitchen are open into one another as shown in pictures, but large enough for a table and eating area plus a designated living room space with couches and chairs. We also have a \"landing nook\" with some storage set up and room for shoes and coats just inside of the front door.\nBathroom has a tub and great shower pressure, as well as a large frosted window so it also gets lovely natural light.\nThis space is great for a single person with pets or a couple.\nEmail me for more photos, a video walk through, or to stop by and view in person.
