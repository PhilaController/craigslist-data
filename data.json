Our pup Chance has been going there for years and we're all going to miss the community at Orianna! There's permit street parking and we are usually able to park within a few blocks of the intersection of 4th and Cambridge; we've found parking to be much easier here than in places like Fairmount and Francisville. And there is quick access to 95 and 676.\nThe apartment is very comfortable. The master bedroom easily fits a king size bed and has its own bathroom, and the guest room\/second bedroom can also fit a king size bed. We have both been able to work from home easily with dedicated work spaces in each bedroom.\nThere is some flexibility for start date but our preferred is 7\/15. If you move in on 7\/15, we'll cover the rent for the rest of the month!
