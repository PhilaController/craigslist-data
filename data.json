Since I will be leaving the US - I am happy to leave the place furnished\/partially furnished.\nThe apartment is possibly the nicest unit in the building - all windows have views of gorgeous trees, and it is across the street from an elementary school - so you hear the kids play at recess weekday mornings - not so loud that it can't be tuned out by closing the windows - but sort of adds to a sense of lightness in the space.\nThere is plenty of storage - the apartment is cat friendly - and there is free laundry in the building and all utilities included except electric. (Yes - even internet!).\nThere is a small galley kitchen fit with dishwasher and garbage disposal - and bath and shower that runs very hot water.\nI am flexible as to when the lease takeover can happen - especially if you want to acquire some or all of my furniture - which will make my move out easier. I am happy to include the furniture at no extra cost. (Including my TV).\nThe neighborhood is wonderful - I have lived in West Philly on and off over the years - this apartment is around the corner from the local 44 - which serves delicious food and a vast selection of local\/imported beers. There are tons of restaurants nearby - including a Pho place, Mexican a few blocks a way, and lots of Ethiopian and Middle Eastern restaurants. And the sort of hub of the community - Baltimore Ave. and Clark Park are a 5 minute walk away - as is the MFL and trolley lines. There is almost always parking available outside of the building.\nPlease let me know if you are interested - this is an especially good building for students. And the maintenance is always prompt and accessible. Very safe and quiet unit - I never hear neighbors - which I think has to do with the walls being somewhat sound proof. Great for a student or professional - spacious enough for a couple, and affordable enough for a single resident.\nThanks!\nJulia","num_images":5,"lat":39.952522,"lng":-75.209264,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'available jun 1', 'flooring: wood', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-04-29T14:18:18-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/downingtown-mail-room-schedule-tour\/7477475335.html","post_id":7477475335,"result_date":"2022-04-29 14:27","title":"Mail Room, Schedule a Tour, Leasing Now","description":"The Point at Downingtown is offering brand-new studio, one and two-bedroom apartments in Downingtown, our community connects you to the beauty of the outdoors while also keeping you just a short distance away from both Center City Philadelphia and King of Prussia.
