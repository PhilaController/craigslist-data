There is no doing you wrong with the state of Oregon.Hello, and thank you for read our post. You see my sister and I our middle aged 64 and 70. And we want to live where our family members our. Grandkids.. The problem is we are limited to how much money we can come up with. The most we can afford is 2800.00 total that 1st, last and deposit. We can pay 1200.00 a month rent plus utilities. So if there is any one out there that might have a granny flat or a small house or apt and would rent it to us with the 2800.00 please please give us a call. Thank you and have a great day. I am a clean and responsible person. I am looking for a room with flexible rent in Roseburg up to $600 a month. I need a place ASAP. I have steady income . Kaplan International is looking for host families to take scholarship students from Saudi Arabia starting October 8th! These students will need a room for 1 month or longer, depending on their situation. These are working professional students in their 20s and 30s who will be studying in intensive English courses for 6 months. Pay Rates: 14 meals a week (continental breakfast and dinner) Single room: $200 per student per week Being a host family for an international student can be a rewarding experience for both students and hosts. Our families reflect the diversity of families in North America including young, senior and single-parent families, families with teenagers or families with Our hosts don't have to be from the US originally, but we do ask that they are fluent in English in order to give our students real world English language practice. Although we have many different kinds of families, they all share a willingness to open their hearts and homes to our international students. At KI, new students arrive weekly and their length of stay ranges from two weeks to one year. Our students are 16+, with the average age being around 19-20 - but often, we get students in their 20s, 30s, and sometimes 40s - 60s! Generally, students request the homestay booking of two meals a day, continental breakfast and dinner, and a clean room with a bed and desk for the students. Students book with us in advance, then we place them with host families - but all of our students are primarily here to study English at our school. One important factor in deciding whether a host can join our program is their location. We ask that host families live within a maximum 90-minute commute to Kaplan (located in Downtown Seattle), and close to public transportation, as we don't ask hosts to take students to school. If you would like the fun and enriching experience of hosting an international student, please let me know your email address when you reply to this add, and I will send @@@@PLEASE TAX ME:    show contact info","num_images":1.0,"lat":40.0018,"lng":-75.1179,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-09-17T17:25:27-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/paulsboro-419-berks-st-unit\/7535138747.html","post_id":7535138747,"result_date":"2022-09-17 17:23","title":"419 W.

We will seek a 2 bed 2 bath place. I am a but It does not matter who wants to get a place with me. I have decent credit too. Mature, 27yr old-soul DV survivor & 9yo daughter need housing. We are currently living in a shelter that I'm pretty sure is not even up-to-code and we're quickly growing weary. I work full-time for a non-profit. She's in elementary school. We are quiet, clean, and respectful people. I am drug\/tobacco-free with no criminal record. I have excellent credit with no evictions and can provide references. I'm offering $900-$1000 a month and will pay a higher deposit if you would so require. Our birthdays (one month apart) are coming up and nothing would be more wonderful than a real place to live!
