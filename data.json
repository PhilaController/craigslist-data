Pets Ok. $1050 Plus utilities, Close to shopping centers and parks. If you are interested please TEXT ME your number\nMy name is Brook (), I\u2019m new in town from Boulder, Colorado and I\u2019m looking for a great, friendly household to join starting between now and October 1st. Budget around $900-$1,000 plus or minus. I would love to have a wonderful home community to return to after a day of work and life outside the house, loving life in Bend, and occasionally have dinner together or head out with our friends to the many great events around town. Either a mix of genders or all guys is great. I am seeking a clean place where I feel comfortable having friends over occasionally for hanging out, card games and dinner. A bit about me- I'm a cheerful, clean, creative, fun outdoorsy guy and I enjoy a peaceful and positive community household with people with active lives anywhere from late 20s to early 40s. As a housemate I'm flexible, tidy, aware of others, clean up after myself (particularly in the kitchen), load and run the dishwasher and sweep, can compromise and accommodate, and I tend to lift the energy of the room. No drugs, little drinking. I love biking everywhere, swimming, trail running, kayaking, casual rock climbing, adventuring and exploring. I have worked in education, youth development and team leadership, and I've lived in France, Spain, Mexico and Germany and I speak those languages plus Brazilian Portuguese. I don't watch TV. I have steady income from properties in Boulder, CO, I'll be looking for a job in customer service or youth development, and pay rent on time. I already got set up socially here in Bend and play adult dodgeball, volleyball, am bouldering at the Circuit and do the Thursday night cruiser ride, and I'm eager to get out for some karaoke. IN NEED OF A RENTAL HOUSE- 3-BEDROOM. For 3Adults & 1Child. HAVE GREAT REFERENCES!!! 30+Years with housing authority of Snohomish County,(section 8). The Rent is paid on the 1st of each month ALWAYS! 3-Adults and 1-Child. We have NO PETS! Looking North End of Lynnwood to Everett.

Hoping to find someone with some land that I can rent a small space from so I can set up a tent! It\u2019s not a big tent and I don\u2019t need any amenities. I\u2019ll pay a agreed upon amount weekly. I pretty much just need a place to keep my stuff during the day and a place to sleep at night. I\u2019m a clean person and I stay out of trouble!! Let me know thx Where to start well lets see i am posting this for me and my disabled parents i am disabled as well so yeah and we have a blue heeler dog he is 8 years old we need a long term place to park are rv it is an 07 alfa gold 5th wheel it is 39 feet long with 3 tipouts we can't afford a lot but if all the utilities are included that's a big plus and we have 2 pickups and a mini van ho before i forget we are also crafters we make and sell thinks some on the internet some with 10 by 10 awning and tables so we can get space for that would be nice well anyway thanks for looking. Im looking for room. I can trade work for rest of month and pay next month. I remodel homes and do landscaping. I\u2019m 41. Single and just me. No pets. Hopefully you have pup. I have some work in Corvallis. I like exploring ares. I cook. I\u2019m not messy person. Seeking rental, preferably out of town, but doesn\u2019t have to be if it\u2019s the right place. Quiet, respectful, middle aged and indoor, clean, well-trained cats looking for long term rental. Seeking the same - Quiet & respectful landlord\/set-up. I have lived on a landlord's property for years and have excellent references. Please text or call. Thank you. We are a couple looking for a place to sleep. Sleeping in cars has gotten pretty old the last 9 months and despite having over 12,000 dollars saved up over the course of those 9 months, we still don\u2019t qualify to rent anything anywhere. I have poor credit due to letting a car repair credit card slip accidentally (and I\u2019m bad at bureaucracy and have no idea how to repair it) and she\u2019s been at the DoorDash game for less than a year. We both do DoorDash all day every day. She rises early and sleeps about 10pm latest. I rise late and dash til I crash about 3\/4am. We each pull in about 1k\/week. We both hustle. I\u2019m drug and alcohol free and she smokes pot but only at night before bed and wouldn\u2019t bring it out of her property\/car. We wouldn\u2019t be around too much. We just want a place to sleep and finding housing is near impossible in this county. We just got back from burning man and are a little tired and looking for an actual bed. (I\u2019m pretty much required to go every year. I help build \u2018the temple\u2019 and am fairly keyed in for life in my role on that crew) Thinking of springing for a hotel for a few days but figured I\u2019d beg here again. Nothing against port orchard or poulsbo, but the dashing game is Bremerton and silverdale so ideally we\u2019d want to be closer to there and not have a long drive but honestly we\u2019ll take anything. We\u2019d like to keep it less than 1k per month. 2 adults. No drama. She\u2019s boring, I\u2019m a cult leader and fun, we won\u2019t be around much. Room, shower, laundry but not really required. We ain\u2019t fancy. We just want a place to sleep. A place to take off from and a place to land. We have two cars. We dash together from 5-9pm otherwise\u2026.we off alone in our own cars. We ARE rampant smokers but will do this outside the home and likely in our own vehicles. We\u2019re big o. Self reliance and leaving no trace. We\u2019d of liked an apartment but perfect credit required and working your job longer than 9months is apparently a thing\u2026.and we can\u2019t keep paying 50 dollars over and over again to places that have had 15+ people apply before us. Will start with emails and then go face to face over lunch or something. Facebook stalk me at buck bandersnatch or google \u201cuncle Buck\u201d and \u201cburning man\u201d and I\u2019m sure one of the stupid videos people have made will turn up. We\u2019ll stick with just us-images from burning man this time. That\u2019s where we met. That\u2019s where my role and soul lies. It\u2019s a long story but temple comes first. We burn it down, yes. We have to. It\u2019s how tangential zen crap works. Good times.","num_images":5.0,"lat":39.9677,"lng":-75.1735,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1Ba', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-09-11T10:09:41-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/downingtown-fitness-center-incredible\/7532503679.html","post_id":7532503679,"result_date":"2022-09-11 10:26","title":"Fitness Center, Incredible Features, Central Location","description":"VIEW OUR WEBSITE:\nhttp:\/\/thepointatdowningtown.com\nBe the first to live at The Point at Downingtown.
