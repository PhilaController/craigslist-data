Looking for a downtown Philadelphia apartment near Rittenhouse Square? You've found it! ICON is the most exciting rental property to ever grace Rittenhouse Square. A quintessential example of the Art Deco exuberance that defined the 1920s and 30s, ICON's design is inspired by Art Deco's geometric shapes and today's streamlined lifestyle. With this historic luxury building, you can be within steps of all the fine dining, high-end retail and cultural offerings that Philadelphia has to offer. The most fashionable edifice of its day, ICON is as rich in history as it is in beauty. Opened in 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression, the building's ground floor tenants included both Cunard's White Star Line and the United States Lines, and the esteemed Pew family maintained a pied-a-terre on the 25th Floor. Today, this history echoes throughout ICON, a building that is a rare architectural experience. The lobby is so stunning it will make you stop in your tracks, with its Art Deco-styled elevators, glazed black brick and grey porcelain flooring and a cast-bronze portal.
