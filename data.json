I\u2019m a hard working person I had to come back to Oregon because my mom is on hospice. Yet I have to live in my car. Any affordable leads would be appreciated. Hello Portland! My name is Monica. I recently got to Portland after 9 years abroad teaching English and studying Eastern Culture (I love India and Nepal!). I also spent a few years in Mexico. Hablo espanole si quieres practicar conmigo! Mi espanole no es lo mejor pero podemos practicar! :) If you rent me a room I will give you unlimited free Spanish lessons. Bring your friends! Free for everyone.\nMy story is weird. I am supposed to be in Buenos Aires finally starting my English school\/ art gallery for marginalized communities, but I had to return to the USA for a dental implant! I had a bad horseback accident a year ago, my front tooth was knocked clean out! I am in Portland to get good quality medical care. It is the ONLY reason I am in the USA. The process will take about one year, as the healing periods between surgeries are super long. I would not be a bedridden smelly sad sack in your house though, the facial swelling only lasts a week after each surgery. In a year, I will have my magic teeth and can leave this rotting land of avarice.\nMy first surgery will be in a few weeks. I am still teaching online, will be getting a job at a shelter soon. After 5 continents and 30 countries, I have never been anywhere as dynamically and needlessly tragic as Portland. So much suffering, so many people lost in a broken system. And a general populace that claims impotence. C'mon y'all, this is downright shameful. This country has gone to total shit, legal weed is cool though.\nDuring some post op healing periods, I will not be working. My father can personally guarantee that my rent will be paid, and he would be happy to talk with a prospective renter on the phone. He is paying for all rent I cannot cover and all rent\/medical for the coming year.\nI love teaching, yoga, fitness, meditation, books, hiking, camping and sometimes 420. Not much drinking anymore, never wasted. I must admit I am a psychonaut (every few months or so to gain perspective). I am fairly solitary and aside from art projects and lots of adventures, I am usually reading.\nI would be happy to rent a room, garage, trailer (I mean, tiny house. Sorry Portland, haha) I would even be happy to rent a tent space in your back yard! I can pay up to 900 per month for whatever I end up renting. I have not driven in 17 years and don't plan on it. I skateboard and bicycle a lot though.\nHello! Middle aged who is employed full time looking for a long term platonic non furnished room for rent. Starting over after divorce and struggling with today\u2019s housing costs. I am looking for something safe and reliable for myself and my medium sized well behaved dog sometime around July 23rd.

I've recently stayed in hostels so I fully understand communal living and being considerate of roommates. I'm quite easy going friendly and generally keep my opinions to myself. Conscious & considerate of other people is absolutely how I would describe myself. I'm 420 friendly, enjoy an occasionally glass of wine and watching tv shows in my room. I enjoy going to the gym, hiking and being outdoors doing things when I have the time. I do have a job and cash saved so rent\/utilities wont be an issue.

I\u2019m a hard working person I had to come back to Oregon because my mom is on hospice. Yet I have to live in my car. Any affordable leads would be appreciated. Hello Portland! My name is Monica. I recently got to Portland after 9 years abroad teaching English and studying Eastern Culture (I love India and Nepal!). I also spent a few years in Mexico. Hablo espanole si quieres practicar conmigo! Mi espanole no es lo mejor pero podemos practicar! :) If you rent me a room I will give you unlimited free Spanish lessons. Bring your friends! Free for everyone.\nMy story is weird. I am supposed to be in Buenos Aires finally starting my English school\/ art gallery for marginalized communities, but I had to return to the USA for a dental implant! I had a bad horseback accident a year ago, my front tooth was knocked clean out! I am in Portland to get good quality medical care. It is the ONLY reason I am in the USA. The process will take about one year, as the healing periods between surgeries are super long. I would not be a bedridden smelly sad sack in your house though, the facial swelling only lasts a week after each surgery. In a year, I will have my magic teeth and can leave this rotting land of avarice.\nMy first surgery will be in a few weeks. I am still teaching online, will be getting a job at a shelter soon. After 5 continents and 30 countries, I have never been anywhere as dynamically and needlessly tragic as Portland. So much suffering, so many people lost in a broken system. And a general populace that claims impotence. C'mon y'all, this is downright shameful. This country has gone to total shit, legal weed is cool though.\nDuring some post op healing periods, I will not be working. My father can personally guarantee that my rent will be paid, and he would be happy to talk with a prospective renter on the phone. He is paying for all rent I cannot cover and all rent\/medical for the coming year.\nI love teaching, yoga, fitness, meditation, books, hiking, camping and sometimes 420. Not much drinking anymore, never wasted. I must admit I am a psychonaut (every few months or so to gain perspective). I am fairly solitary and aside from art projects and lots of adventures, I am usually reading.\nI would be happy to rent a room, garage, trailer (I mean, tiny house. Sorry Portland, haha) I would even be happy to rent a tent space in your back yard! I can pay up to 900 per month for whatever I end up renting. I have not driven in 17 years and don't plan on it. I skateboard and bicycle a lot though.\nHello! Middle aged who is employed full time looking for a long term platonic non furnished room for rent. Starting over after divorce and struggling with today\u2019s housing costs. I am looking for something safe and reliable for myself and my medium sized well behaved dog sometime around July 23rd.

I've recently stayed in hostels so I fully understand communal living and being considerate of roommates. I'm quite easy going friendly and generally keep my opinions to myself. Conscious & considerate of other people is absolutely how I would describe myself. I'm 420 friendly, enjoy an occasionally glass of wine and watching tv shows in my room. I enjoy going to the gym, hiking and being outdoors doing things when I have the time. I do have a job and cash saved so rent\/utilities wont be an issue. I'm more than ok with shared chores & nessecities. I love pets but currently dont have any. I'm looking to rent somewhere near the Matt Dishman Community Center and the near the Red Robin. I think Id be a great fit as your hopeful future roommate.\nQuiet, responsible, and respectful & trustworthy middle aged couple with 15 pound corgi terrier, seeking small rental. We currently reside in & have been in Southern Oregon 12 years.\nExcellent references!\n(We have never paid rent late one time in all this time)\nWe host\/produce a national & syndicated FM radio show ( for 23 years now) & are into gardening, music, reading, Tai Chi & metaphysics.\nHello there so I am looking for a nice clean room available to rent but only for about a month. I'm looking to pay around $400. I am currently unemployed but am seeking employment at this time. I just need a safe, stable, and clean room to rent to lay my head at night.

Hi there. I'm a longtime New Yorker whose life was briefly derailed last Fall by medical issues and a flooded apartment (the roof of my Bushwick apt. caved in during Hurricane Ida) so I've been living upstate for nine months and am looking to move back to the city in August or September. I can pay up to $1500\/month. I work in publishing (primarily remotely) and am laid-back, quiet, responsible, and considerate. I'm also very friendly and social and get out and about quite a bit. Nothing much bothers me (believe me, I've seen it all and really been through it in terms of apartment problems, etc). I lived alone for a long time but almost bankrupted myself; that's why I'm looking for a roommate now. I'm a in my late 20s and my lease is up at my current place in Bushwick, but I found an apartment for Aug 1st, so I'm in need of a July sublet for one month! I'm a manager at a bar, so I'm usually pretty busy and just want somewhere to come home to while I get ready to move into my new place. I'm looking for somewhere in Bushwick or Williamsburg and less than $1000. PM me if you know of anything!!\nFast and Easy Move-in! You only need cash and valid photo I.D. card - WOW it's that easy!! No credit or background check. Nice furnished all bills paid unit including HD TV, full size bed, chairs, dresser, cabinet, refrigerator and microwave. SOLO PERSON daily rates from $59 plus tax, weekly rates from $299 plus tax and four week monthly SPECIAL from only $899!!! Clean, Safe and Quiet.

The first level has an open floorplan, smoothly flowing from living room to dining room to kitchen, all with great natural light. Built-in shelves allow for functional and attractive storage for books, plants or your favorite treasures. In the kitchen, additional custom built-in shelving over the ample counter space smartly allows for more attractive and accessible storage without sacrificing the natural light from the large kitchen window. You can grill, entertain and dine al fresco with ease as you pass through the kitchen back door to a covered deck and spacious back yard, ready for any and all outdoor activities you desire. Back inside, head upstairs past the lovely hand-painted mural and fine handcrafted balusters to the 2nd level which houses 2 bedrooms, a full hall bathroom and hall closet. The rear bedroom with new hardwood flooring was most recently used as a textiles studio but can easily be used as a regular bedroom, office, nursery or guest room. The renovated hall bath has clever custom built-in storage for easily accessible but well-hidden extra necessities as well as handsome and unique fixtures. Pass the hall closet to the spacious front bedroom with double wide closet and dressing area. From there, head up to the 3rd level to find an additional small room that would be perfect for an office or nursey, a half bath and another full bedroom with double wide closet. With this charming house you can have the often-elusive combination of a big yard without sacrificing all the perks of city living. It\u2019s an easy walk to the Kensington Co-op, coffee shops, restaurants and public trans while also being close to I-95 for driving convenience.
