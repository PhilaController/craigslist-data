I am looking for a reliable tenant to rent out the middle bedroom of my 3 bedroom \/ 2 bathroom Ardmore home located on a quiet but wonderfully walkable street only 6 blocks to town center with easy driveway and street parking. (1 person only, no couples or pets due to local occupancy laws and housemate pet allergy). The house and room are already fully furnished. The bedroom has a queen bed and 2 dressers. The living room features leather couch, large marble tables and a 65 inch TV. The kitchen features a Hitchcock kitchen table, stove, refrigerator, garbage disposal and dish washer. Your lease includes use of a washer and dryer unit in the basement. I have bedroom furniture available if you need it as well.\nThere is one full bathroom upstairs and one downstairs. The middle bedroom is 110 square feet and includes a closet. The two other tenants you would be living with are: (James (32), an EMT Haverford College grad Class of 2012 and Suli (34), a server at Teca. Utilities (electric, gas, water and internet) are split evenly between the three tenants (relatively low due to the home's newer efficient boiler, insulation throughout, brand new Marvin Elevate fiberglass windows and a brand-new Provia Signet fiberglass front entry door). There is a nice private back yard and large deck. Parking is never an issue with the home's long driveway and plenty of off-street parking. The street itself is very pleasant, scenic and quiet, mostly populated by families and young couples. Having a few guests over for dinner is fine but wild house parties certainly are not allowed, and so are significant others that are \u201calways there\u201d (guests allowed overnight max 5 nights\/month unless permitted by other tenants). Because the house is occupied by courteous roommates and surrounded by families, drunken loud-at-2AM party people need not apply! The house is kept reasonably clean (but not to the point of total neat freak) so we need someone who is willing to do their fair share of the cleaning on a regular basis. Tenants also responsible for shoveling snow and are expected to do their part to keep the driveway and walkways clear. The location of the home is excellent with everything the prestigious Ardmore, Main Line and Lower Merion area has to offer. Living in this home, you can enjoy a short 7-block walk to the train station where you can get into center city in less than 20 minutes. The majority of the town's shopping, nightlife and restaurants are less than a mile away, featuring Suburban Square (7 blocks), Carlino's Specialty Italian Foods (3 blocks), Tired Hands Brewery (8 blocks) and the great township parks. The home boasts a great central location, with an easy commute to: Center City Philadelphia: 10 miles, (Manayunk \/Roxborough:5 miles) (Villanova University: 4 miles) (Saint Joes, Wynnewood Bala Cynwyd: 4 Miles) (Cabrini & Eastern: 6 miles) (Bryn Mawr and Haverford College: 2miles) (Radnor: 6 miles) (Wayne: 7 Miles) (Devon: 9 miles) (Berwyn: 10 miles) (Paoli and Malvern: 12 miles) (Havertown: 1 Mile) (West Chester: 18 miles) (King of Prussia: 10 miles)\nMONTHLY ROOM PRICE = $699 + 1\/3 utilities\n*Minimum 3-Month lease required, along with first\/last month\u2019s rent and a security deposit equal to one month's rent. Annual rent increase will never exceed the rate of inflation (CPI).\n$2,097 = Initial Payment\/Room Deposit = First and Last month's rent + $699 security deposit. ( $699+ $699 + $699)\nProfessionals: Another benefit to living in Ardmore is that there is NO LOCAL WAGE TAX.\nPlease send an email for further inquiry.\nPLEASE NOTE: All those wishing to apply after viewing the property must pass a check of their credit, proof of income, criminal background and eviction history, just as past tenants have. After you pay the application fee ($35), your keys will be given to you once the initial payment is received and processed.","num_images":21.0,"lat":40.002,"lng":-75.2966,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2Ba', '110ft2', 'available mar 1', 'air conditioning', 'furnished', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-02-07T00:15:15-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-nice-bedroom-bath-on-the\/7586788736.html","post_id":7586788736,"title":"Nice 2 bedroom, 1 bath on the 2nd floor above Coffee Planet","description":"Nice 2 bedroom, 1 bath on the 2nd floor above Coffee Planet available .
