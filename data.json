Two roommates are looking for someone to fill a bedroom in our East Kensington apartment. We\u2019ve lived here just about a year, and it\u2019s been great. There\u2019s plenty of space, a giant roof deck, and it\u2019s only a block away from the York\/Dauphin stop on the El, so getting around the city is super easy. Parking is never a problem either. The open bedroom is on the first floor and has a cute balcony. Your bathroom is right outside the bedroom. Rent is $1000 a month + utilities so altogether it\u2019s ~$1000. Move in would be July 1, but we can try and work with you if you\u2019re looking to make an earlier move.\nAbout us: We are two young professionals in our twenties!

Lots of natural light.\nThere were no shortcuts taken during this 2010 full-gut remodel. Almost everything was replaced and has many refined finishes including: exposed brick, new drywall, fresh paint, overhead and accent lighting, new doors, new wiring, new carpet, new laminate-flooring, new kitchen, new bathroom, and is fully insulated (which is rare for S Philly) with extensive sound-reduction techniques (in floors and interior walls).\nThis is a unique place.  Everyone loves the place in-person, and it is usually rented on the first showing.  That being said, it is not a large 2-bedroom apt., there isn't outdoor space, it is on the 3rd floor, and the storage areas are limited (to just 2 bedroom closets, the hallway shelving, and kitchen cabinets).

While small, the layout is very efficient\/thoughtful and this top floor unit is filled with character and light.\nLocation:  10th and Ellsworth is near South Street, Italian Market, and the Passyunk Ave corridor.
