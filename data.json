I just moved here two months ago from New Orleans. I\u2019ve been staying with my girlfriend but we are splitting up. I\u2019m a fun outgoing guy who enjoys his whiskey, 420, finding awesome taco trucks, art, music, music, music, laughing, documentaries. I\u2019m 43 years old. Got a lot of tattoos. I work as a professional chef and cook at home but not much. When I do cook I clean up. I am a very neat, clean and orderly person when it comes to my bedroom and common spaces. I do not have any pets, no drama, no BS. Just a down to earth fun outgoing guy that keeps to himself for the most part. I\u2019m cool with all animals and have no allergies. I don\u2019t need much just hoping to find a bedroom that is furnished. I don\u2019t want to spend more than $1,300.00 but am a bit flexible. Feel free to text me with your spot and details.\nHello, I am your newest tenant and have great references to share with you too! I am a young, single, hard-working lady in my 20s with no pets looking for a new place to live. I\u2019m very responsible, clean, quiet and respectful. I don\u2019t party and spend most of my time just working. I am born and raised in Santa Cruz County and love this area. I have family and my work close by and so am trying to stay local.\nI work full time, Monday-Friday + some weekends outside of the house (not work-from-home) helping to direct traffic for a traffic control company. I have been working there for two years and have a stable union employment.\nI will treat your property like my HOME with such care!\nI have good rental history and great REFERENCES.\nPREFERENCES-\nI\u2019m looking for the following:\n\u2022Within 10-20 miles of Watsonville away from town. (Aromas, Prunedale, Corralitos, Royal Oaks etc)\n\u2022One bedroom, Granny unit, in-law, stand alone or more etc.\n\u2022500+ square feet\n\u2022Full kitchen\n\u2022Washer\/dryer in the unit would be nice but not deal breaker\n\u2022$1,600 budget give or take (including utilities)\n\u2022No roommates\/housemates\nHi there\nI'm looking for a place to park and sleep from 10pm to 6am. I work approximately 16 hours a day and need a place that's safe with no loud music.\nI have a 2017 tacoma with a shell on the back and it's set up to sleep comfortably. I will probably need it for 2 months maybe more but hopefully not.\nI don't drink or smoke and very trustworthy.\nThanks and have a great day \ud83d\ude00\nHi there! I'm seeking to be of mutual aide via a caregiving\/living space trade or partial trade. I cannot for the life of me get craigslist to correct my pic - it's vertical in my files so I'm confused. I figure it's better you see me, with your head cocked like an owl, than not...\nI do work 30 hours a week caregiving in Lincoln Heights, and have time around that to offer. I'm in my mid 40's, have been in the Bay Area for twenty years, and my first career was in social justice inside mental health initiatives. I decided that more simpler work that allows me to do art is a better fit. I have 4 years of caregiving experience - mobility assistance, cooking, med prompting, and light housekeeping. I LOVE to cook for folks, and provide activities that give more involvement. I garden. I'm handy with tech. I have good references. I have my own car and am vaccinated and boosted and careful with exposure. I don't have animals, but I do love them. The context of this request is that having transitioned to a less lucrative career since the pandemic, staying in the East Bay is hard without a situation like this, and secondly, I've been in a healthy, warm space in Richmond which is now undergoing an unexpected and onerous construction project and being at home is no longer enjoyable. I would look forward to a conversation with you about how we might help each other. I'm easy to find on LinkedIn if you want to look at that, also - it reflects my previous career.\nWe're a family (4 members) living in this house. We currently have one room available now. We're looking for someone (single ) who needs a small place to stay for study or work. It's a small room with 10' X 10' (10 Sq. Ft) and shared bathroom with another person. Utilities are included on this and basic needs.\nAround the area is peaceful and quiet. The address is close by at many stores. We require 1 month advance and 1 month deposit.\ni need a 2 bedroom apt. or home to rent for about 2 months in the city of lakeport, while my home is being remodeled. i have two small dogs that are house broken and are great dogs! my home had some water damage from a broken pipe!\nnon smoker, no drugs! great reference!!!! very clean person!We are retired, very responsible and exceptionally clean. We have our criminal history, credit report, excellent references. WE NEED a 2 or 3bdrm House or Duplex or Townhouse in Klamath Falls. We have a 12lb dog, very well-mannered and house trained. Long Term Rental needed while we have a house built and purchase a lot.\nWe are currently in a position where we have to leave the rental we are in now. We have 4 cats and in the backyard we keep a small coop with 4 chickens and 1 rooster who we love and consider them all part of the family. With how hard it\u2019s been to find a place in southern Oregon we are worried we might have to find a home for the animals. Just the thought of this breaks our hearts. We have lived in our current place for 3 years and pay rent on time every month. Please email me if you have anything available.\n","num_images":1.0,"lat":39.9474,"lng":-75.1473,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 1Ba', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-09-19T09:00:09-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-newly-renovated-bedrooms\/7535633512.html","post_id":7535633512,"result_date":"2022-09-19 09:03","title":"NEWLY RENOVATED 3 BEDROOMS & 2 BATHS HOME LOCATED IN OVERBROOK!","description":"\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 LOOK NO FURTHER!

This creates significant tax savings by accelerating depreciation. Most owners will see around 6-10% of the building cost in extra cash flow through this reduction in taxes. For example, a $1mm cost basis will create $60K-$90K through this application. We always do a free analysis so that owners can review it with their CPAs, partners, etc. I would be glad to provide more detail if needed.\nThanks\nMark","num_images":9.0,"lat":39.9362,"lng":-75.1563,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 2Ba', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'furnished', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-09-19T15:36:53-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/horsham-great-place-to-live\/7535833773.html","post_id":7535833773,"result_date":"2022-09-19 15:33","title":"Great Place to live","description":"Furnished Studio - Great Monthly Rates!Take advantage of our special discounted rate!
