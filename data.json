Embracing the passion for repurposing, the two story home is clad in HardiePlank cement board siding and corrugated metal panels. The strong design lines are tempered by a bucolic setting of 5.5 acres of orchards, perennials, and woodlands. Sullivan Building and Design completed the new construction in 2013, presenting a 2700 square foot, one bedroom home that is comfortably spacious with inspired design. A custom made iron walkway leads to the front porch and inside to a functional entryway space, playfully outfitted with massive chalkboard clad closet doors and a colorful Eames Hang-it-all . Beyond is the Gathering Room, a bright, generous interior space featuring two story high ceilings and distinctive farm lighting fixtures. Distinguished by polished cement floors, the space features a reading alcove lined with Rakks library shelving, a linear gas fireplace and opens to the large dining area perfect for large scale entertaining or an intimate gathering place. A modern Gourmet kitchen, the centerpiece of the home, features custom made cabinetry with stunning matched grain detailing by Cider Press Woodworks. The kitchen is equipped with a suite of high end stainless steel appliances including a Wolf cooktop and oversized stainless hood, sleek soapstone countertops, and a massive eat-in waterfall island creating a dramatic effect. Enjoy a morning cup of coffee or an evening with friends on the screened-in porch offering a relaxing place to enjoy the tranquility of the private landscape. A main floor Master Suite with sliding barn door and custom walnut drawer night stands, is complete with an adjoining dressing room and spa-like master bath. The rooms are thoughtfully enhanced with built in shelving, louvered lockers for additional storage, a laundry area, and an exterior side door leading to a deck and outdoor garden shower. The second floor with exotically beautiful hardwood floors, offers a large loft for an office or possible third bedroom. A generously sized second bedroom has a beautiful Juliette balcony and treetop views. The elegantly clad hall bath features a relaxing jetted soaking tub and a seamless glass shower. Endless possibilities with the insulated unfinished walk-out basement. Stepping stones and perennial gardens lead to the two story, three car garage designed by White Dog Studios of Lambertville, complementing the home with exterior corrugated panels, solar panels and galvanized standing seam roof. Inside, options abound with an art studio, workshop, and greenhouse as well as storage on the second floor. Additional two car parking is available beneath the carport that offers covered interior access to the home. Throughout the property, the clean, design lines offer a serene simplicity that is simultaneously sophisticated. Nearby attractions include Lake Galena and Peace Valley Nature Center. Close to Doylestown s museums, local shopping and dining as well as Central Bucks Schools.
