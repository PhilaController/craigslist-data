This is the preferred date, but could go as late as June 1st.\nApartment is on the 3rd floor in a 4-unit historic house. There is no elevator.\nThe room you see in the photos with the more slanted ceilings is the bedroom. The living room and kitchen are one combined room.\nThe price includes water and gas. Tenants are responsible for their own electric. The heat is gas, so is paid by the landlord.\nThere are a few closets in the apartment and no storage in the rest of the building.\nLaundry is coin-operated, in the basement, shared with the tenants of the other three apartments.\nThere is a large yard for all tenants to share.\nPets are ok, small refundable deposit required.\nNo smoking.\nWe are a small company, management and owners all live close by in Germantown. Maintenance and repairs are done with independent contractors, there are no employees on call.\nWHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:\nWe always prefer to rent to folks who are already part of the community, so if you're in Germantown, we'd love to keep you here.\nWe look for income to be 3 times the amount of rent, because we want to know that you can afford it. So here that would mean income of around $3075\/month.\nWe want tenants who will be considerate of their neighbors in terms of sound and how they use the space. We ask for a reference from a previous landlord so that we can find out about past experience.\nPlease be familiar with the area before expressing your interest. It is up to you to determine \"how the neighborhood is,\" \"is it safe?\" etc. These are personal questions I can't answer for you. Personally I've lived in this area quite a while now; I love it and I feel safe. You may be different.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nIf this sounds like you, please send a message. You will be asked to fill out a *brief* application prior to the scheduling of a showing. Know that we do not waste time showing our apartments to as many people as possible. So if you meet the criteria and you fill out the application, you are not wasting your time. There is no application fee.","num_images":6.0,"lat":40.032314,"lng":-75.169211,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'available may 15', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-04-03T16:02:16-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-looking-for-completed\/7606458402.html","post_id":7606458402,"title":"LOOKING FOR A COMPLETED RENOVATED HOME - 3 BED 2 BATH !!!","description":"Then look no further then this home in West Philadelphia!
