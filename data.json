Quiet, tree-lined street.\nRarely available unit--all prior tenants stayed for at least 3 years.\nYou have the entire backyard to yourself. Stamped concrete patio, small grassy area, raised beds. Yard maintenance is the tenant\u2019s responsibility-if you aren\u2019t interested in some light yard work this is not be the place for you.\nKitchen completely renovated 5 years ago with new appliances, lots of cabinet space, and granite counter tops. Dishwasher and garage disposal.\nLayout (see my sketch): front bedroom, bathroom with shower stall, open kitchen & living room in the middle, and back office\/den overlooking the backyard. There are two cased openings to this room WITHOUT doors, so it is open to the living room and would not work as a 2nd bedroom, but it offers a lot of useful space. Bedroom is carpeted (less than 5 years old), bath\/kitchen tiled, hardwood in living room, low pile carpet in the office.\nLots of storage in the shared basement with washer and dryer for your  use only.\nCentral A\/C.\nApprox 625 sq feet.\nThe attached photos are three years old, when I listed it for the current tenant. She will try to send me updated photos this week (busy resident so she isn't home much), but it you are interested can email me for the new photos. Hasn't changed much since these pictures, though she has done a good amount of yard work, so that's the only area that is very different.\nUpstairs unit occupied by long-term physician tenants. Very convenient to UPenn\/CHOP\/HUP. Route 40 & 17 are only a couple blocks away. Owner as well as most of the current and past tenants have been HUP physicians\/residents.\nOwners manage the unit from out of state, so we need tenants who are fairly self sufficient for minor issues. We have a handyman\/plumber\/electrician etc, and are quick to handle any major issues that arise. But any repairs less that $100 we expect the tenants to handle.  For example, the front door coded lock stopped functioning well. We bought a new one, but the upstairs tenant installed it. Our tenants have always found us responsive, but the relationship works best when we are all on the same page.  If you are only used to renting in apt buildings with on site maintenance, this would be a slight change.\nI'm trying to limit showings only to seriously interested renters, as the unit is currently occupied and would need to be coordinated with the tenant. I am trying to do a more thorough screening than average with interested tenants to make sure that the apt could potentially meet your needs. Happy to answer any questions by email if you have any questions\/concerns that could be handled before you see the apt. Please provide details about yourself and what you are looking for in an rental so I can better understand what you are looking for.\nOne cat is ok. Dogs decided on a case by case basis, for an additional monthly fee.\nAvailable as early as June 1, but any early or mid June start would be accepted.\nTenant pays all utilities (around $100\/mth for water\/gas\/electric).","num_images":15,"lat":39.943062,"lng":-75.175996,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', '650ft2', 'available jun 1', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'flooring: wood', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: yearly']","posted_date":"2022-03-23T02:16:45-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-renovated-old-city-apt\/7461764955.html","post_id":7461764955,"result_date":"2022-03-22 23:25","title":"Renovated Old City Apt - Central Air, In-Unit Laundry, Exposed Brick!","description":"Beautifully renovated apartment features central air, in-unit washer\/dryer, exposed brick and a walk-in closet!
