Please contact only if you are SERIOUS.\nRent from $650 to $950Hello, I am posting this because me n my family are in serious need of help. Me, my girlfriend and our 5yr old son have been living in hotels since LAST FEBRUARY. Long story short, right after COVID, we lost our 4br house that we were renting in the bensalem area. We both have full time jobs, and desperately need a more stable and safer place for our family. I have been paying daily for hotel rooms ever since we lost the house in February. My girlfriend just started work about 2 months ago. So proof of income on both parties are not an issue. The issue is that we don't have ANY money for a down payment. We don't have first, last OR a security down payment. Every penny that I make has been going towards the hotel room or gas in the car or food to survive. We are both hard working and don't cause any trouble. We need to find a private landlord who is willing to help us get a better place, please. With both incomes we bring in just over 4,000$ a month. Have no car payments or any other monthly cost right now. Again the problem is getting the security, 1st and last down payments together. It is the holiday season and I'm praying that someone will see this and give us a chance. Please contact me via email through this post if you can help. Thank you !!!Would like to rent a room in a family home or share a home.\nPrefer the Henrico, Glen Allen, Richmond or Chesterfield area.\nI am a responsible drama free .\nI do not drink or smoke.\nI always pay my rent a couple days prior to the due dateSo I\u2019m in a delema i lost a job been waiting for unemployment for 4 weeks and just started a new job but only part time. I\u2019m looking to rent a room for like 500 to 600 a month if possible and really can\u2019t afford first and last. I know there are wonderful people out there and hope to hear from someone. I\u2019m an honest, kind, quiet, respectable guy that just needs a place to live.Hi. My name is Chris. I just started a new job here in Manasses. Long story short (I can share face to face more) I just started a great job Monday, yesterday. I was trying to get my check from my last job (another area of VA) but it was returned to my job. I am now in the negative and driving on fumes. I am asking an altruistic person assistance in either of the two requests:\n1. If someone could lend me $1-$10 dollars for gas (or if you have a container and can bring some here) so I am not completely stranded and if you send me your address, I can pay you when I get my first check. So I am just asking for a loan to get me out of E (empty) in gas. I am currently in the Barnes-n-Nobles shopping center near Sudley Road? I can text you my exact location. My former job mailed another check out yesterday so should get it, Im hoping by tomorrow, Wednesday so I can pay you back. This is a good job and I just need to remain on my feet and be strong the next couple of weeks. I don't like asking for help because I don't think there are any more good people out there and if there are, this is who I am trying to reach. I am an honest soul.\n2. I am going to need to look for a place since I am moving up here. I do not do any substance abuse, do not drink and do not smoke (quit). It is just me. I do not have any furniture etc but I will be able to help with assisting in purchasing furniture and other household stuff when I get paid. I am clean, organized, an empath and good-hearted person. I actually like to cook and clean. It is RARE now-a-days to find these qualities in others. Looking for same. I won't get paid until around the 20th or two weeks later. I am requesting either: a place to stay temporarily to help me out and I can pay something decided on both of us when I get paid (ill sign a contract). AND\/OR if there are any other good people out there and you are personable, responsible, honest ETC maybe we can chat about being roommates. If you are reading this and you don\u2019t yet have a place, I am open to anywhere within one hour from here-Manasses (because of my job).\nBUT right now I could use any 'loan' of up to $10.00 for gas (or gas itself!). My phone will probably be turned off anytime today (hopefully it will be as late as possible) otherwise, please email me. I will let you know my exact location. Sorry, I don't trust most people and most do not have good intentions.\nI can assist in chores, keeping up with daily house chores, assist with animals, etc. I like all animals. I am open to either gender\/all genders. Text me for more information or if you can help me out asap with gas\/gas money to be paid after I get paid.\nI will be on zoom for orientation at 10:30am until about 3pm today, 12.6.2022. I can check my text during breaks.

Please contact only if you are SERIOUS.\nRent from $650 to $950Hello, I am posting this because me n my family are in serious need of help. Me, my girlfriend and our 5yr old son have been living in hotels since LAST FEBRUARY. Long story short, right after COVID, we lost our 4br house that we were renting in the bensalem area. We both have full time jobs, and desperately need a more stable and safer place for our family. I have been paying daily for hotel rooms ever since we lost the house in February. My girlfriend just started work about 2 months ago. So proof of income on both parties are not an issue. The issue is that we don't have ANY money for a down payment. We don't have first, last OR a security down payment. Every penny that I make has been going towards the hotel room or gas in the car or food to survive. We are both hard working and don't cause any trouble. We need to find a private landlord who is willing to help us get a better place, please. With both incomes we bring in just over 4,000$ a month. Have no car payments or any other monthly cost right now. Again the problem is getting the security, 1st and last down payments together. It is the holiday season and I'm praying that someone will see this and give us a chance. Please contact me via email through this post if you can help. Thank you !!!Would like to rent a room in a family home or share a home.\nPrefer the Henrico, Glen Allen, Richmond or Chesterfield area.\nI am a responsible drama free .\nI do not drink or smoke.\nI always pay my rent a couple days prior to the due dateSo I\u2019m in a delema i lost a job been waiting for unemployment for 4 weeks and just started a new job but only part time. I\u2019m looking to rent a room for like 500 to 600 a month if possible and really can\u2019t afford first and last. I know there are wonderful people out there and hope to hear from someone. I\u2019m an honest, kind, quiet, respectable guy that just needs a place to live.Hi. My name is Chris. I just started a new job here in Manasses. Long story short (I can share face to face more) I just started a great job Monday, yesterday. I was trying to get my check from my last job (another area of VA) but it was returned to my job. I am now in the negative and driving on fumes. I am asking an altruistic person assistance in either of the two requests:\n1. If someone could lend me $1-$10 dollars for gas (or if you have a container and can bring some here) so I am not completely stranded and if you send me your address, I can pay you when I get my first check. So I am just asking for a loan to get me out of E (empty) in gas. I am currently in the Barnes-n-Nobles shopping center near Sudley Road? I can text you my exact location. My former job mailed another check out yesterday so should get it, Im hoping by tomorrow, Wednesday so I can pay you back. This is a good job and I just need to remain on my feet and be strong the next couple of weeks. I don't like asking for help because I don't think there are any more good people out there and if there are, this is who I am trying to reach. I am an honest soul.\n2. I am going to need to look for a place since I am moving up here. I do not do any substance abuse, do not drink and do not smoke (quit). It is just me. I do not have any furniture etc but I will be able to help with assisting in purchasing furniture and other household stuff when I get paid. I am clean, organized, an empath and good-hearted person. I actually like to cook and clean. It is RARE now-a-days to find these qualities in others. Looking for same. I won't get paid until around the 20th or two weeks later. I am requesting either: a place to stay temporarily to help me out and I can pay something decided on both of us when I get paid (ill sign a contract). AND\/OR if there are any other good people out there and you are personable, responsible, honest ETC maybe we can chat about being roommates. If you are reading this and you don\u2019t yet have a place, I am open to anywhere within one hour from here-Manasses (because of my job).\nBUT right now I could use any 'loan' of up to $10.00 for gas (or gas itself!). My phone will probably be turned off anytime today (hopefully it will be as late as possible) otherwise, please email me. I will let you know my exact location. Sorry, I don't trust most people and most do not have good intentions.\nI can assist in chores, keeping up with daily house chores, assist with animals, etc. I like all animals. I am open to either gender\/all genders. Text me for more information or if you can help me out asap with gas\/gas money to be paid after I get paid.\nI will be on zoom for orientation at 10:30am until about 3pm today, 12.6.2022. I can check my text during breaks. Thanks four three four 882 9281 charlottesville area code\nThanks,\nChris\n","num_images":8.0,"lat":39.94269,"lng":-75.226487,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 1Ba', '1128ft2', 'available now', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'w\/d hookups', 'detached garage', 'rent period: monthly', 'wheelchair accessible']","posted_date":"2022-12-06T19:23:41-0500"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/7565462772.html","post_id":7565462772,"result_date":"Wed Dec 07 2022 00:18:44 GMT+0000 ","title":"Spacious & Elegant Duplex Apt.","description":"Located in quiet Aldan, PA, this beautiful apartment combines the comforts of suburban living with the convenience of nearby public transportation and fast access to Center City, I-95 and I-476.\nThis 970-square-foot unit has high ceilings, beautiful, original wood trim, and finished hardwood floors in its formal dining room, spacious living room, and two large bedrooms.
