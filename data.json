Easy access to 47 bus line, street parking.\nFeatures: Washer & Dryer, garbage disposal, gas cooking, gas forced air heat, central air, exposed brick & beams, built-in shelving, hardwood floors, coat closet, 2 bedroom closets, bathroom closet.\nDrawbacks: Call it 'cozy' if u like, but this place is small!  It is very ample for a single person, even feasible for a couple, but this is not a large house, truly 500 square feet, not including the unfinished basement with W\/D.  It is however very nicely laid out with lots of closet space.  There is also basically no yard or outside space.  There is a small alley out the back suitable for storing trash\/recycling, which leads to a secure shared breezeway to the street.\nWater is included in the rent, tenant pays other utilities.\nSorry no pets.

High ceilings and hardwood floors provide an open first floor with multiple possibilities for configuration. A living\/dining area towards the front of the home is separated from the spacious galley kitchen by a must-have powder room. The kitchen boasts an extra-tall Liebeherr refrigerator and other stainless steel appliances along with deep cabinets covering three walls of the room.

Mature rose bushes serve as nature\u2019s beautiful backdrop for your future dinner parties, barbeques, or lazy Sundays sipping your morning coffee.  Up the first flight of stairs you\u2019ll find two bedrooms, a full bathroom, and a hallway linen closet. The sunny back bedroom has four windows, an unusually large amount for a rowhome of its kind, and a spacious mirrored-closet. The front facing bedroom also features a closet, as well as a private nook with a built-in bookcase. Both the separate shower and bathtubs in the hallway bathroom are decorated with blue glass tiles, the vanity has been recently updated, and a bathroom closet offers major appeal.  The third floor is home to the primary en-suite with a bonus room full of possibilities. Originally a back patio, the current owners had decided to enclose the space that is now home to 2 separate built-in shelving areas, a large window providing natural light, and an extraordinary antique pocket door - think additional bedroom, office, nursery, media room, work-out area or meditation space. Transition to the spa-like primary bathroom where you\u2019ll find a large carrara-marble lined shower with a bench for relaxing and adjustable shower heads. A soaking tub with turquoise glass tile accents completes the room. The large bedroom comes with a ceiling fan, walk-in closet, vaulted ceilings, and is large enough to fit a king bed with end tables and more.  A clean and dry basement with front-loading LG laundry machines completes the home - partially finish it or keep it as-is, you pick!
