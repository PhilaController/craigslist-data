There are just a few homes on this no-thru street, where  you'll experience serenity & seclusion, yet you know who your neighbors are. A 5-car,Y-shaped  d\/way leads to this place w\/an architectural shingle roof. The entire house is surrounded by land (.36 acres). & the neighbors have quite a bit of land as well, so, as you can see, you are really purchasing an affordable dream.!

There is a double, louvered  bifold door on the pantry, loads of maple cabinets w\/soft-close drawers & cabinets w\/stainless steel pulls. stainless sink too! The  tent-style vent for the black & white electric stove matches the cabinetry! The vinyl floor in neutrally designed, the DW is Kenmore. The Formica  counter top is gray. The stairs to the 2nd floor originate in the LR, & lead to 3 BR's & a full ceramic-tiled bath.

We like music (making and listening), talking about politics & history, comfort-food TV, general ridiculousness. We\u2019re looking for a housemate who is at least comfortable with kids and at most actively excited about hanging out with them.\nAbout the space: it's on the second floor, with big south-facing bay windows and plenty of room (about 20 feet by 20 feet, plus two closets). Wood floors. Can be furnished or not. The adjacent bathroom (big jetted tub for relaxing, plus separate shower) is mostly private to you. The laundry room is down the hall, next to the guest room\/office.\nThe rest of the house: 3 bedrooms on the third floor; first floor is living room, dining room (with nice piano, guitars, ukulele, music books, giant dinner-party-sized table), well-equipped kitchen, mudroom with half bath. Central air conditioning, supplemented with window units on 2nd and 3rd floors. Unfortunately, the house isn\u2019t wheelchair accessible.\nDetails:\n- $850\/month covers rent and all the utilities.\n- The room will be available starting about July 15, but we\u2019re flexible on move-in.\n- We prefer a short-term (4-6 month) lease, but open to long term for the right person.\n- We're very vaccinated and you should be too.\n- No smoking anywhere around the house, even on the porch, please. Ideally no smoking at all anywhere.\n- Street parking usually available, but also very public-transit-accessible. 52 bus around the corner, 34 trolley a five-minute walk, MFL 10 minutes.\n- Potentially open to another dog.\n","num_images":7.0,"lat":39.950773,"lng":-75.225856,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'available jul 15', 'air conditioning', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-06-12T21:35:38-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/king-of-prussia-beautiful-bedroom-bath\/7631919243.html","post_id":7631919243,"title":"Beautiful 3 Bedroom 2 Bath Single Family Home For Rent!
