Center City Philadelphia Apartments near Rittenhouse Square Be a part of history! ICON mixes the beauty of the past with the modern amenities of today.

Looking for a downtown Philadelphia apartment near Rittenhouse Square? You've found it! ICON is the most exciting rental property to ever grace Rittenhouse Square.

With this historic luxury building, you can be within steps of all the fine dining, high-end retail and cultural offerings that Philadelphia has to offer. The most fashionable edifice of its day, ICON is as rich in history as it is in beauty. Opened in 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression, the building's ground floor tenants included both Cunard's White Star Line and the United States Lines, and the esteemed Pew family maintained a pied-a-terre on the 25th Floor. Today, this history echoes throughout ICON, a building that is a rare architectural experience. The lobby is so stunning it will make you stop in your tracks, with its Art Deco-styled elevators, glazed black brick and grey porcelain flooring and a cast-bronze portal. And the residences feature the kind of classic fixtures, state-of-the-art appliances and iconic details that can only be found in a landmark building.
