There is no elevator.\nHardwood floors, clawfoot tub, several windows\nThere is no dedicated living room in this apartment. There's a very spacious kitchen with room for a table, and there's a large bedroom where you could fit a couch, desk, etc. in addition to your bed.\nThe price includes water and gas. Tenants are responsible for their own electric. The heat is gas, so is paid by the landlord.\nThere are a few closets in the apartment and no storage in the rest of the building.\nLaundry is coin-operated, in the basement, shared with the tenants of the other three apartments.\nThere is a large yard for all tenants to share.\nPets are ok, small refundable deposit required.\nNo smoking.\nWe are a small company, management and owners all live close by in Germantown. Maintenance and repairs are done with independent contractors, there are no employees on call.\nFirst, last, and security required to sign lease\/receive keys.\nNote- the kitchen cabinets are no longer green\/gray!\nWHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:\nWe always prefer to rent to folks who are already part of the community, so if you're in Germantown, we'd love to keep you here.\nWe look for income to be 3 times the amount of rent, because we want to know that you can afford it. So here that would mean income of around $2925\/month.\nWe want tenants who will be considerate of their neighbors in terms of sound and how they use the space. Other tenants in this building are fairly quiet and considerate, but friendly. The floors are hardwood so often rugs may be required to deal with issues of sound traveling between floors.\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nIf this sounds like you, please send a message. You will be asked to fill out a *brief* application prior to the scheduling of a showing. Know that we do not waste time showing our apartments to as many people as possible. So if you meet the criteria and you fill out the application, you are not wasting your time. There is no application fee.\n","num_images":6,"lat":40.032314,"lng":-75.169211,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'available jul 15', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'apartment', 'laundry in bldg', 'street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2023-06-09T11:36:30-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-great-views\/7630614326.html","post_id":7630614326,"title":"Great views!","description":"YES, WE ARE OPEN!
