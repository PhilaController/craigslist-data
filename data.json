All three units are occupied by tenants whose leases will be honored. The restoration of 432 Tasker St. was undertaken with the utmost care, skill and attention-to-detail. Taken down to the brick walls in 2012-2014, this building has been beautifully\/tastefully upgraded. Renovations include: new electrical (100 amps, each unit), a roof, genuine hardwood floors, windows, stainless steel appliances, granite counter tops, in-unit washers\/dryers (stacked), allocated and secured basement storage-lockers for each unit in a clean\/dry basement, wide\/well-maintained, well-lit halls and stairwells, a 1st floor rear courtyard\/garden, and a 3rd floor deck. In addition, this building offers occupants an extra measure of safety and peace of mind with a state-of-the-art fire suppression\/sprinkler system. This building conforms to all current building codes. Although the pictures indicate an unoccupied building, this building has been fully occupied on an on-going basis with only a few minor interruptions for pandemic-related issues. It is currently fully occupied. With rental properties in ever-increasing demand, a new owner might expect full residency to continue without interruption (while rents continue to very steadily increase as well!).

Please note:48 hours advance notice needed so that all three units will be available for showing. Thank you. Please note: We have used the taxes as listed for 2023 on the Phila.gov official city website. However, there is currently a system of tax-reassessment going on in the city of Phila.
