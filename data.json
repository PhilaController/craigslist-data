I must move out of state immediately and need somebody to take over my lease. I am giving you almost a full month of free rent and paying your security deposit.\nThis place has no weight restrictions on cats or dogs of all sizes but aggressive breeds restricted (refer to leasing office for more info). No more than 2 pets (either 1 cat and 1 dog, or 2 cats, or 2 dogs).\nFor rent is a 2-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment. About 1100 square feet. All hardwood floor except the 2 bedrooms, which are carpet.\nThe master bedroom is about 13 feet by 16 feet not including the walk in closet or full bathroom.\nThe second bedroom is about 10 feet by 14 feet not including the closet.\nClothing washer and dryer included. Automatic dishwasher included. The stove top is a ceramic cooktop. Has an oven and a broiler.\nYou are getting almost a full month free and keep my security deposit when you move out if you take over my lease with about 8 months left on it. If you want a longer lease, you can choose a longer term than 8 months and your rent will go down. For example, the rent is currently $2,095 per month, but if you choose a 16-month lease, it will go down to $2,025.\nYou are essentially paying for the last 7 months of my lease but staying here for 8 months, plus getting back my security deposit if the leasing office decides to return it. Not up to me, up to them.\nAll applicants must be able to provide proof of income to the leasing office. Combined household income of all applicants must be equal to or greater than $6,300 per month. Proof of income must be a PDF from your payroll provider or your banking website.\nYou need to pay a $75 application fee to the leasing office and specify it is for unit #325. They accept credit card as a form of payment.\nYou need three recent pay stubs from your current employer, or proof of retirement income, or proof of govt payments (disability, social security) or proof of court ordered alimony or child support payments.\nI have paid the rent up until May 01, 2022. You will be responsible for the rent from May 01 until the move out date, approximately 10 months from February 8th. I think that would be November 8th.\nI have already paid the security deposit, and I do not need it back.\nIf you want to see the corporate web site, check it out here but don't apply here without communicating with me, first https:\/\/comehometomeadowbrook.com\/\nMore than ample parking available in this gated community for you and all your guests right outside your door.\nOne neighbor has a Doberman Pinscher, another has a malamute. Neither has ever made a sound. This place allows dogs of all sizes.\nThe heat works excellent, but I hardly used it. Without running the heat at all, the master bedroom was about 58 degrees in the winter, the kitchen was about 65 degrees. I joked my neighbor's heat is probably warming my place up. The coldest months are behind you.\nPet fee is $300 non-refundable fee. There is an additional $35 per month pet rent for up to 2 pets.\nYou are required to have a weird insurance. The leasing office recommends Lemonade as the insurance company, so I used them. My insurance was $10 per month and was more than the minimum the leasing office required. I think the minimum would have been $8.50 per month.\nI pay $45 per month for 300 mbps, the most affordable plan. 1200 mpbs is available, maybe $70 per month? Not sure. Only one internet provider is available, Xfinity.\nAll utilities other than internet are paid online with the rent to Lindy Corp.\nAmenities include:\nWasher and dryer\ndishwasher\ncentral heating and air\nrefrigerator\nmicrowave\nDog Park and Dog Wash\nCommunity Garden\nBarber shop on site\nplayground\nolympic sized swimming pool\nFitness center (free on-site gym)\nFree weights\nPool table\nTennis Court\nHigh Speed internet (I pay $45 per month for 300 mbps\nPay rent online\n24-hour emergency maintenance\nThe only damage right now is where a 1-inch circle of paint is missing when I removed a command sticky hook from the wall. I can provide photos from when I moved in of existing damages, such as a scuff on the kitchen floor. You will be responsible for any damages beyond my deposit, or you can have the remainder of my deposit when you move out. You are responsible for my portion of unpaid utilities, which were minimal. I am 1 person, was rarely home, never used the stove or oven or broiler, just the microwave but usually ate out at restaurants, fast food, or with friends who can cook.","num_images":18.0,"lat":40.1284,"lng":-75.0607,"attrs":"['2BR \/ 2Ba', '1100ft2', 'available now', '\\nwednesday 2022-03-30\\n', '\\nthursday 2022-03-31\\n', 'air conditioning', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'flooring: wood', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'off-street parking', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-03-29T19:12:57-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-950-studio-for-rent\/7464604797.html","post_id":7464604797,"result_date":"2022-03-29 19:25","title":"$950 Studio for rent\/Utilities included","description":"Studio apartment in quiet and safe street with separate entrance from the nice backyard.\nWalking distance to Roosevelt Blvd and Bustleton Ave bus lines, shopping plazas and restaurants.\nAll utilities and internet included!
