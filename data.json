Again, this is lease transfer not subleasing. So you take over the lease for the remaining period 1st June 2022 through 6th Sept2022 and I am out of the lease agreement. Since, the apartment management will be holding the deposit of $500 till the end of the lease period, the new lease signer have to pay the outgoing tenant (that's me!) $500, directly. You will get back your deposit from the apartment management after the completion of your lease period based on the terms and agreement of lease. The apartment is in great condition, as I keep it clean, non-smoker, no pets and hardly cook. So basically, you will get an apartment like a new unfurnished one, short term at a very reasonable rate compared to rent on similar apartment in this area.\n","num_images":5.0,"lat":39.951577,"lng":-75.165493,"attrs":"['1BR \/ 1Ba', 'available jun 1', '\\nsaturday 2022-05-14\\n', '\\nsunday 2022-05-15\\n', '\\ntuesday 2022-05-17\\n', 'air conditioning', 'flooring: wood', 'apartment', 'w\/d in unit', 'no smoking', 'no parking', 'rent period: monthly', 'wheelchair accessible']","posted_date":"2022-05-08T22:49:16-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-large-artists-loft-with\/7481249815.html","post_id":7481249815,"result_date":"2022-05-08 22:30","title":"Large Artist's loft with gated parking","description":"Large, Attractive New York-style loft with gated parking available for rent.
