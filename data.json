Allen M. Stearne (K-8) & Frankford High (9-12) Schools.\nLEASE & DEPOSIT\nOne year lease term with subsequent auto-renewing month-to-month lease extension. $1050 per month (RentZestimate\u00ae is $1099).  A security deposit equivalent of TWO months rent, plus FIRST & LAST month rent, for a total of $4200 is due at the time of the signing of the lease (plus any applicable pet deposit)\nPAYMENT METHODS\n*NOTE: Deposit may be made in cash, or by EFT (Ca$happ, Zelle, Venmo, Paypal), ONLY. I feel as though EFT is best because it can go directly to into my escrow account as required by law, and that means you will immediately & exactly know where your deposit is being held. Nobody argues with cash, however, including me. Cash will always be king. No checks. No 3rd party payments. I have my reasons for doing this . The main one is to avoid being scammed (again & again) by bounced check into letting a squatter with no intention to pay gain entry to my house (its happened before), plus checks are so dated, slow, & easily forged or badly written to manipulate time frames to the max and can really jam up business. I despsie checks; another reason is to establish that you are independent & reliable and capable of making timely monthly rent payments on your own. Its very aggravating to have to repeat this whole process in 3 months because mom paid your deposit and you couldnt afford to keep making rent and I have to go through Eviction Diversion. So likewise, no co-signator to the lease. After deposit is paid, we can discuss paying by check if that is how you prefer to pay your monthly rent. If this is an issue for you, no hard feelings & i'm sure there are plenty of other places currently for rent in Philly, as I'm sure there are plenty of other prospective tenants besides you*\nUTILITIES\nTenant is responsible for paying all utilites including PWD (water), PECO (electric), & PGW (gas). Trash & recycling colllection is provided free of charge by the Dept. Of Streets. One blue recycing bin is provided for your use. Trash cans are the responsibility of the tenant.\nWater Heater, Range, & Furnace Ignition Switch\/Blower are all electric. Furnace Fuel Source is Natural Gas.\nADDITIONAL TERMS\nUp to 2 pets allowed, $50 pet deposit per.\nSmoking is permitted on the premesis but please be responsible & courteous about the butts.\nRent is due on the 3rd of each month, with a grace period until the 13th because, well,  shit happens. Late rent payments in excess of 10 days, and insufficient funds returns, subject to additional fee.\nNo Section 8 or vouchers are accepted.\nLost keys are subject to $50 replacement fee. Lockout services are $125 per occurrence.\nAPPLICANTS\nThe ideal applicant will have a credit score at 600 or above, favorable references, gainful employment, and satisfactory credit & rental history, free of any judgements or evictions. All applicants are considered equally,fairly, & without discrimination or immmediate disqualifcation for any one derogatory mark,  regardless of their past, race, religion, age, sexual orientationz and I encourage people from all backgrounds, heritages, & walks of life to apply.\nAPPLICATION PROCESS\nNevertheless, a routine personal background check is still required, as is the associated non-refundable $30 application fee, payable by EFT. No walk-throughs will be scheduled before application & fee have been collected as to not waste anybodys time. It is a very busy time of the year and as limited as my time is already with twins expected any time between now & Christmas, I also live in Trappe - 45 minute trip each way with no traffic - and work in Boyertown - 56 min trip each way with no traffic - so getting down here to show the places I have for rent is time consuming and very tricky.\nSo unfortunately if you arent qualified, there is no sense in you seeing it or me having to drive down to show it to you. I don't mean to be rude, its just being practical & honest. I do, however, try to work with everyone, but in order to get past sub-600 credit scores and past evictions, at a minimum, your monthly net income must be at least 3x the rent ($750\/week) and have at least one recent glowing reference in regards to making payments in full & on-time. I also do not perform criminal background checks on my applicants. Everyone  deserves a second chance, including felons, and your crime is not my business, not my place to judge you, and not relevant to whether or not you are a good tenant. Your rental - not your criminal - history tells me that.\nMOVE-IN DATE\nReply to this ad to start the process by submitting your application and fee. Won't last long!!! Move-in date is set for 01 January 2023 but I can probably push it to 15 December 2022 (if no water breaks, if no mandatory OT, if no this no that......) but move-in costs would then jump, as pro-rated December rent would need to be paid up front as well. NO HOLDS! Payment of Security Deposit ONLY is required, and the ONLY way, to secure the rental til 01 January. First & Last can be made in advance all at once or when you get the keys.\nINFORMALITIES\nI'm sorry I can't accomodate everyone. Telling people I chose another applicant is the worst part of my role as landlord. Any questions, I am happy to oblige!! A safe & happy holiday season to you all.
