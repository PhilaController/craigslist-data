I am the owner. Feel free to get in touch. The listing is on zillow as well if you need to confirm it's real. Thanks.\n2535 square foot, 4 bedroom, 2.5 bath house with tall ceilings, wood floors and central air on a shady block directly on Dickinson Square park (and playground) for rent from August 15 (ish) 2022 to August 15 (ish) 2023. No continuation of lease or shorter term considered. We can be flexible by days or weeks. Absolutely NO SMOKERS or smoking in the house. House trained pets are welcome!\nThe good sized rear bedrooms along with the living and dining room have had the original oak floors uncovered. The brand new kitchen just doubled in size. The front bedrooms are huge and designed as master suites. They overlook the park and are filled with morning light. The 3rd floor rear bedroom has broad westerly views and tremendous light.\nPossibly partially furnished if you're interested, but not required. The lovely catchment elementary school is Kirkbride. The free (this area does not require a sticker\/permit) street parking is relatively easy given the park (no houses on the other side of the street). Before 6pm we can almost always park right on our block. After 6pm we never have to park more than a block or two away.\nThe neighbors on this block are great - a mix of families, kids, renters. The Delaware River trail is a 7 minute walk. Biking or transiting downtown is under 10 minutes. There are myriad food and drink options in the neighborhood, or take a quick walk to Passyunk Avenue. Multiple grocery stores, corner stores and Target are also a quick walk. Farmer's market in the park every Sunday.\nWater is included. You're responsible for gas, electric and internet. We're happy to answer questions about the house, the neighborhood, schools, etc. Or come by and see it and ask questions in person! If you're out of town we can give you a video walk through. We wish you all luck in your search.

Avoid future out of control rent increases!\nThe best way to buy a home is to buy it outright, which is also something I can assist with so please get in touch! However this rent with the right to purchase program works great for people who might not be able or willing to make the commitment to buy a house right this moment.\nI work with a company called Home Partners that will purchase a home of your choosing. No mortgage approval is needed until you want to buy it. You don\u2019t pick from a small list, but from all houses that are for sale on the market so long as it fits the program guidelines (which honestly does limit options in our Philly market because homes must be built no earlier than 1978, no fixer uppers, only purchase in certain areas, etc. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to help and show you which homes work for this awesome program!) Some current examples that could work are in the photos.\nOnce Home Partners buys the house you choose, they rent it to you at a pre-set price. You can choose to rent it for up to 5 years and you can buy it at anytime during those 5 years. Each year the rent and purchase price will increase but it is set in advance so you\u2019re never surprised. If the housing market improves and you want to buy a different house, you can walk away with no obligation beyond your rental lease. If house prices go up, the price on your home is already locked in and you have the right to buy it without any competing buyers or bidding wars.\nThis is a rent with the right to purchase program, NOT a rent to own. So the rent you pay does not get credited to your home purchase. But in this market, what a great opportunity to lock in your pricing and avoid the headache of having to move again. Plus you can bring your pets! Yes, even large dogs. Some restrictions apply.\nBasics you\u2019ll need to apply and qualify:\n-620 or better FICO score for all applicants\n-Application fee paid directly to Home Partners of $75 per household (not refundable). I will first have you do a free pre-qualification.\n-Documented income. Self employed welcome to apply with last years tax return and 2 months bank statements.\n-Income minimum 3x the monthly rent. Keep in mind that most homes that qualify for this program have rents over $2000 per month and are single family homes or row homes (no condos)\n-Security deposit equal to 2 months rent\nGet in touch to learn how you can move into your dream home now and buy it later- never move again if you don\u2019t want to!","num_images":6,"lat":40.0897,"lng":-74.9781,"attrs":"['3BR \/ 2Ba', 'application fee details: 75.00 per household', 'cats are OK - purrr', 'dogs are OK - wooof', 'house', 'w\/d in unit', 'attached garage', 'rent period: monthly']","posted_date":"2022-07-28T17:50:13-0400"},{"url":"https:\/\/philadelphia.craigslist.org\/apa\/d\/philadelphia-tech-connected-living\/7514586802.html","post_id":7514586802,"result_date":"2022-07-28 17:45","title":"Tech- Connected Living, Quartz Countertops, Package Receiving System","description":"Bedrooms:\u00a00Bathrooms:\u00a01Square Feet:\u00a0321Address:\u00a01401 Arch StreetLocated in Philadelphia\u2019s historic Center City\u00a0neighborhood, One City offers modern elegance with timeless grandeur.

You've found it! ICON is the most exciting rental property to ever grace Rittenhouse Square. A quintessential example of the Art Deco exuberance that defined the 1920s and 30s, ICON's design is inspired by Art Deco's geometric shapes and today's streamlined lifestyle. With this historic luxury building, you can be within steps of all the fine dining, high-end retail and cultural offerings that Philadelphia has to offer. The most fashionable edifice of its day, ICON is as rich in history as it is in beauty. Opened in 1930, at the beginning of the Great Depression, the building's ground floor tenants included both Cunard's White Star Line and the United States Lines, and the esteemed Pew family maintained a pied-a-terre on the 25th Floor. Today, this history echoes throughout ICON, a building that is a rare architectural experience. The lobby is so stunning it will make you stop in your tracks, with its Art Deco-styled elevators, glazed black brick and grey porcelain flooring and a cast-bronze portal. And the residences feature the kind of classic fixtures, state-of-the-art appliances and iconic details that can only be found in a landmark building.
